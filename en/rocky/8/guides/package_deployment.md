Step 7: Deploy to Repository
Once a package is complete and tested, it will be uploaded to the Rocky Linux repository, and picked up/cloned by a network 
of repository mirrors around the world. The Rocky 8 source RPM will of course be uploaded as well.

Users of the distro will then see it when they dnf update or dnf install !
