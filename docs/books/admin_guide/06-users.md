## General

Each user is a member of at least one group: **this is their main group**.

Several users can be part of the same group.

Users can belong to other groups. These users are *invited* to these **secondary groups**.

> :notebook: **NOTE:**
Each user has a primary group and can be invited into one or more secondary groups.

Groups and users are managed by their unique numerical identifiers `GID` and `UID`.

Account and group declaration files are located in `/etc`.
* `UID`: _User IDentifier_. Unique user ID.
* `GID`: _Group IDentifier_. Unique group identifier.

> :fire: **DANGER:**
You should always use the administration commands instead of manually editing the files.

## Group management

Modified files, added lines:

* `/etc/group`
* `/etc/gshadow`

### `groupadd` command

The `groupadd` command adds a group to the system.
```
groupadd [-f] [-g GID] group
```

Example:

```
$ sudo groupadd -g 1012 GroupeB
```

| Option  |	Description                   |
| --------| ----------------------------- |
|`-g GID` |	`GID` of the group to create. |
|`-f` |	The system chooses a `GID` if the one specified by the `-g` option already exists. |
|`-r` |	Creates a system group with a `GID` between `SYS_GID_MIN` and `SYS_GID_MAX`. These two variables are defined in `/etc/login.defs`. |

Group naming rules:

* No accents or special characters;
* Different from the name of an existing user or system files.

> :notebook: **NOTE:**
Under **Debian**, the administrator should use, except in scripts intended to be portable to all Linux distributions, the `addgroup` and `delgroup` commands as specified in the *man*:
```
[root] # man addgroup
DESCRIPTION
adduser and addgroup add users and groups to the system according to command line options and configuration information
in /etc/adduser.conf. They are friendlier front ends to the low level tools like useradd, groupadd and usermod programs,
by default choosing Debian policy conformant UID and GID values, creating a home directory with skeletal configuration,
running a custom script, and other features.
```

### Command `groupmod`

The `groupmod` command allows you to modify an existing group on the system.

```
groupmod [-g GID] [-n nom] group
```

Example:

```
$ sudo groupmod -g 1016 GroupP
$ sudo groupmod -n GroupC GroupB
```

|Option |	Description |
| ------| ----------- |
|`-g GID` |	New `GID` of the group to modify.
|`-n name` | New name.

It is possible to change the name of a group, its `GID` or both simultaneously.

After modification, the files belonging to the group have an unknown `GID`. They must be reassigned the new `GID`.

```
$ sudo find / -gid 1002 -exec chgrp 1016 {} \;
```

### `groupdel` command

The `groupdel` command is used to delete an existing group on the system.

```
groupdel group
```

Example:

```
$ sudo groupdel GroupC
```

> :star: **TIP:**
To be deleted, a group must no longer contain users.

Deleting the last user of an eponymous group will cause the system to delete the group.

> :star: **TIP:**
Each group has a unique `GID`. A group can be duplicated. By convention, the `GID` of system groups range from 0 (`root`) to 999.

> :star: **TIP:**
Since a user is necessarily part of a group, it is best to create the groups before adding the users. Therefore, a group may not have any members.

### `/etc/group` file

This file contains the group information (separated by `:`).

```
$ sudo tail -1 /etc/group
GroupP:x:516:patrick
  (1)  (2)(3)   (4)
```

* 1: Name of the group.
* 2: Password (`x` if defined in `/etc/gshadow`).
* 3: GID.
* 4: Guest members (separated by commas, does not contain core members).

> :notebook: **NOTE:**
Each line in the `/etc/group` file corresponds to a group. Users whose group is their main group are not listed at this level. This membership information is in fact already provided by the `/etc/passwd` file...

### `/etc/gshadow` file

This file contains the security information about the groups (separated by `:`).

```
$ sudo grep GroupA /etc/gshadow
GroupA:$6$2,9,v...SBn160:alain:rockstar
   (1)      (2)            (3)      (4)
```

* 1: Name of the group.
* 2: Encrypted password.
* 3: Administrator of the group.
* 4: Guest members (separated by commas, does not contain core members).

> :warning: **WARNING:**
For each line in the `/etc/group` file there must be a corresponding line in the `/etc/gshadow` file.

A `!` in the password indicates that it is locked.
Thus no user can use the password to access the group (since group members do not need it).

## User management

### Definition

A user is defined as follows in the `/etc/passwd` file:

* 1: Login;
* 2: Password;
* 3: UID;
* 4: GID of the main group;
* 5: Comments;
* 6: Home directory;
* 7: Shell (`/bin/bash`, `/bin/nologin`, ...).

There are three types of users:

* **root**: the system administrator ;
* **system users**:	Used by the system to manage application access rights ;
* **regular user**:	Other account to log in to the system.

Modified files, added lines:

* `/etc/passwd`
* `/etc/shadow`

### `useradd` command

The `useradd` command is used to add a user.

```
useradd [-u UID] [-g GID] [-d directory] [-s shell] login
```

Example:

```
$ sudo useradd -u 1000 -g 1013 -d /home/GroupC/carine carine
```

| Option        |	Description                                                        |
| --------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|`-u UID`       |	`UID` of the user to create.                                       |
|`-g GID`       |	`GID` of the main group.                                           |
|`-d directory` |	Home directory.                                                    |
|`-s shell`     | Shell.                                                             |
|`-c`           | Add a comment.                                                     |
|`-U`           | Adds the user to a group with the same name created simultaneously.|
|`-M`           | Does not create the connection directory.                          |

At creation, the account has no password and is locked.

A password must be assigned to unlock the account.

Account naming rules:

* No accents, capital letters or special characters;
* Different from the name of an existing group or system file;
* Set the options `-u`, `-g`, `-d` and `-s` at creation.

> :warning: **WARNING:**
The home directory tree must be created except for the last directory.

The last directory is created by the `useradd` command, which takes the opportunity to copy the files from `/etc/skel` into it.

**A user can belong to several groups in addition to their main group.**

For secondary groups, the `-G` option must be used.

Example:

```
$ sudo useradd -u 1000 -g GroupA -G GroupP,GroupC albert
```

> :notebook: **NOTE:**
Under **Debian**, you will have to specify the `-m` option to force the creation of the login directory or set the `CREATE_HOME` variable in the `/etc/login.defs` file. In all cases, the administrator should use the `adduser` and `deluser` commands as specified in the `man`, except in scripts intended to be portable to all Linux distributions:
```
$ man useradd
DESCRIPTION
    **useradd** is a low level utility for adding users. On Debian, administrators should usually use **adduser(8)**
     instead.
```

#### Default value for user creation.

Modification of the file `/etc/default/useradd`.

```
useradd -D [-b directory] [-g group] [-s shell]
```

Example:

```
$ sudo useradd -D -g 1000 -b /home -s /bin/bash
```

| Option         | 	Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-D`           | Sets the default values for user creation.                                   |
| `-b directory` | Sets the default login directory.                                            |
| `-g group`     | Sets the default group.                                                      |
| `-s shell`     | Sets the default shell.                                                      |
| `-f`           | The number of days after the password expires before the account is disabled.|
| `-e`           | The date the account will be disabled.                                       |

### `usermod` command

The `usermod` command allows to modify a user.

```
usermod [-u UID] [-g GID] [-d directory] [-m] login
```

Example:

```
$ sudo usermod -u 1044 carine
```

Options identical to the `useradd` command.

| Option         |	Description                                                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`-m`            | Associated with the `-d` option, moves the contents of the old login directory to the new one.|
|`-l login`      | New name.                                                                                     |
|`-e AAAA-MM-JJ` | Account expiration date.                                                                      |
|`-L`            | Locks the account.                                                                            |
|`-U`            | Unlocks the account.                                                                          |
|`-a`            | Prevents the user from being deleted from a subgroup when added to another subgroup.          |
|`-G`            | Specifies multiple subgroups when adding.                                                     |

With the `usermod` command, locking an account results in the addition of `!` before the password in the `/etc/shadow` file.

> :star: **TIP:**
To be modified, a user must be disconnected and have no running processes.

After changing the identifier, the files belonging to the user have an unknown `UID`. It must be reassigned the new `UID`.

```
$ sudo find / -uid 1000 -exec chown 1044: {} \;
```

Where `1000` is the old `UID` and `1044` is the new one.

It is possible to invite a user into one or more subgroups with the options *-a* and *-G*.

Example:

```
$ sudo usermod -aG GroupP,GroupC albert
```

The `usermod` command acts as a modification and not as an addition.

For a user invited to a group by this command and already positioned as a guest in other secondary groups, it will be necessary to indicate in the group management command all the groups to which he belongs otherwise he will disappear from them.

The *-a* option changes this behavior.

Examples:

* Invite `albert` in the group `GroupP`.

```
$ sudo usermod -G GroupP albert
```

* Invites `albert` into the `GroupG` group, but removes him from the `GroupP` guest list.

```
$ sudo usermod -G GroupG albert
```

* So either :

```
$ sudo usermod -G GroupP,GroupG albert
```

* Or :

```
$ sudo usermod -aG GroupG albert
```

### `userdel` command

The `userdel` command allows you to delete a user's account.

```
$ sudo userdel -r carine
```

| Option |	Description                                              |
| -------| --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-r`   | Deletes the connection directory and the contained files. |

> :star: **TIP:**
To be deleted, a user must be logged out and have no running processes.

`userdel` removes the user's line from the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/gshadow` files.

### `/etc/passwd` file

This file contains user information (separated by `:`).

```
$ sudo head -1 /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)  (6)    (7)
```

* 1: Login.
* 2: Password (`x` if defined in `/etc/shadow`).
* 3: UID.
* 4: GID of the main group.
* 5: Comment.
* 6: Home directory.
* 7: Shell.

### `/etc/shadow` file

This file contains the users' security information (separated by `:`).
```
$ sudo tail -1 /etc/shadow
root:$6$...:15399:0:99999:7:::
 (1)    (2)  (3) (4) (5) (6)(7,8,9)
```
* 1: Login.
* 2: Encrypted password.
* 3: Date of last change.
* 4: Minimum lifetime of the password.
* 5: Maximum lifetime of the password.
* 6: Number of days before warning.
* 7: Time to deactivate account after expiration.
* 8: Account expiration time.
* 9: Reserved for future use.

> :fire: **DANGER:**
For each line in the `/etc/passwd` file there must be a corresponding line in the `/etc/shadow` file.

## File owners

> :fire: **DANGER:**
All files necessarily belong to one user and one group.

The main group of the user creating the file is, by default, the group that owns the file.

### Modification commands

#### `chown` command

The `chown` command allows you to change the owners of a file.
```
chown [-R] [-v] login[:group] file
```

Examples:
```
$ sudo chown root myfile
$ sudo chown albert:GroupA myfile
```

| Option |	Description                                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-R`   |	Changes the owners of the directory and its contents. |
| `-v`   |	Displays the executed changes.                        |

To change only the owner user:
```
$ sudo chown albert file
```
To modify only the owner group:
```
$ sudo chown :GroupA file
```
Changing the user and owner group:
```
$ sudo chown albert:GroupA file
```
In the following example the group assigned will be the main group of the specified user.
```
$ sudo chown albert: file
```

### `chgrp` command

The `chgrp` command allows you to change the owner group of a file.
```
chgrp [-R] [-v] group file
```
Example:
```
$ sudo chgrp group1 file
```
| Option | Description                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-R`   | Modifies the owner groups of the directory and its contents (recursion). |
| `-v`   | Displays the executed changes.                                           |


> :notebook: **NOTE:**
It is possible to apply to a file an owner and an owner group by taking as reference those of another file:

```
chown [options] --reference=RRFILE FILE
```
For example:
```
chown --reference=/etc/groups /etc/passwd
```

## Guest management

### `gpasswd` command

The command `gpasswd` allows to manage a group.
```
gpasswd [-a login] [-A login] [-d login] [-M login] group
```
Examples:
```
$ sudo gpasswd -A alain GroupA
[alain]$ gpasswd -a patrick GroupA
```

| Option     |	Description                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `-a login` |	Adds the user to the group.         |
| `-A login` |	Sets the group administrator.       |
| `-d login` |	Remove the user from the group.     |
| `-M login` |	Defines the complete list of guests.|

The command `gpasswd -M` acts as a modification, not an addition.
```
# gpasswd GroupeA
New Password :
Re-enter new password :
```

### `id` command

The `id` command displays the group names of a user.
```
id login
```
Example:
```
$ sudo id alain
uid=1000(alain) gid=1000(GroupA) groupes=1000(GroupA),1016(GroupP)
```

### `newgrp` command

The `newgrp` command allows you to temporarily use a secondary group for file creation.
```
newgrp [secondarygroups]
```
Example:
```
[alain]$ newgrp GroupB
```

> :notebook: **NOTE:**
After using this command, the files will be created with the `GID` of its subgroup.

The command `newgrp` without parameters reassigns the main group.

## Securing

### `passwd` command

The `passwd` command is used to manage a password.
```
passwd [-d] [-l] [-S] [-u] [login]
```
Examples:
```
$ sudo passwd -l albert
$ sudo passwd -n 60 -x 90 -w 80 -i 10 patrick
```

| Option | Description                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-d` | Removes the password.                                    |
| `-l` | Locks the account.                                       |
| `-S` | Displays the account status.                             |
| `-u` | Unlocks the account.                                     |
| `-e` | Expires the password.                                    |
| `-n days` | Minimum password lifetime.                          |
| `-x days` | Maximum password lifetime.                          |
| `-w days` | Warning time before expiration.                     |
| `-i days` | Delay before deactivation when the password expires.|

With the `passwd` command, locking an account is accomplished by adding `!!` before the password in the `/etc/shadow` file.

Using the command `usermod -U` command only removes one of the `!`. So the account remains locked.

Example:

* Alain changes his password:

```
[alain]$ passwd
```

* root changes Alain's password

```
$ sudo passwd alain
```

> :notebook: **NOTE:**
The `passwd` command is available to users to change their password (the old password is requested). The administrator can change the passwords of all users without restriction.

They will have to comply with the security restrictions.

When managing user accounts by shell script, it may be useful to set a default password after creating the user.

This can be done by passing the password to the `passwd` command.

Example:
```
$ sudo echo "azerty,1" | passwd --stdin philippe
```
> :warning: **WARNING:**
The password is entered in clear text, `passwd` takes care of encrypting it.

### `chage` command

The `chage` command is used to manage the account strategy.
```
chage [-d date] [-E date] [-I days] [-l] [-m days] [-M days] [-W days] [login]
```
Example:
```
$ sudo chage -m 60 -M 90 -W 80 -I 10 alain
```

| Option | Description                                    |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `-I days` | Delay before deactivation, password expired.|
| `-l`      | Displays the policy details.                |
| `-m days` | Minimum lifetime of the password.           |
| `-M days` | Maximum lifetime of the password.           |
| `-d AAAA-MM-JJ` | Last password change.                 |
| `-E AAAA-MM-JJ` | Account expiration date.              |
| `-W days` | Warning time before expiration.             |

The `chage` command also offers an interactive mode.

The `-d` option forces the password to be changed at login.

Examples:
```
$ sudo chage philippe
$ sudo chage -d 0 philippe
```

> :notebook: **NOTE:**
If no user is specified, the order will concern the user who enters it.

## Advanced management

Configuration files:
* `/etc/default/useradd`
* `/etc/login.defs`
* `/etc/skel`

> :notebook: **NOTE:**
> Editing the `/etc/default/useradd` file is done with the `useradd` command.
> The other files are to be modified with a text editor.

### `/etc/default/useradd` file

This file contains the default data settings.

> :star: **TIP:**
When creating a user, if the options are not specified, the system uses the default values defined in `/etc/default/useradd`.

This file is modified by the command `useradd -D` (`useradd -D` entered without any other option displays the contents of the `/etc/default/useradd` file).

| Value      | Comment                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GROUP`    | Default group.                                                           |
| `HOME`     | Path where the login directory for the user's name will be created.      |
| `INACTIVE` | Number of days after the password expires before the account is disabled.|
| `EXPIRE`   | Account expiration date.                                                 |
| `SHELL`    | Command interpreter.                                                     |
| `SKEL`     | Skeleton directory of the login directory.                               |
| `CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL` |	Mailbox creation in `/var/spool/mail`.                          |

> :warning: **WARNING:**
Without the `-g` option, the `useradd` command creates a group of the user's name name and places it there.

In order for the `useradd` command to retrieve the value of the `GROUP` field from the `/etc/default/useradd` file, you must specify the `-N` option.

Example:
```
$ sudo useradd -u 501 -N GroupeA
```

### `/etc/login.defs` file

This file contains many default parameters useful for creating or modifying users. This information is grouped by paragraph according to their use:
* Mailboxes;
* Passwords ;
* UID and GID ;

### `/etc/skel` directory

When a user is created, their home directory and environment files are created.

These files are automatically copied from the `/etc/skel` directory.
* `.bash_logout`
* `.bash_profile`
* `.bashrc`

All files and directories placed in this directory will be copied to the user tree when they are created.

## Identity change

### `su` command

The `su` command allows you to change the identity of the connected user.
```
su [-] [-c command] [login]
```
Examples:
```
$ sudo su - alain
[albert]$ su -c "passwd alain"
```

| Option | Description                                           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `-` |	Loads the user's complete environment.                   |
| `-c` command |	Executes the command under the user's identity.|

If the login is not specified, it will be `root`.

Standard users will have to type the password for the new identity.

> :star: **TIP:**
There are successive 'layers' created (a stack of `bash' environments). To switch from one user to another, you must first type the `exit` command to take back your identity and then the `su` command to take another identity.

#### Profile loading

`root` endorses the identity of the user `alain` with `su`:

```
...
/home/GroupA/alain/.bashrc
/etc/bashrc
...
```

`root` assumes the identity of the user `alain` with `su -`:

```
...
/home/GroupA/alain/.bash_profile
/home/GroupA/alain/.bashrc
/etc/bashrc
...
```

A user can temporarily (for another command or an entire session) assume the identity of another account.

If no user is specified, the command will be for `root` (`su -`).

It is necessary to know the password of the user whose identity is being endorsed unless it is `root` that is executing the command.

An administrator can thus work on a standard user account and use the rights of the `root` account only occasionally.
