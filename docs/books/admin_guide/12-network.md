## Generalities

To illustrate this chapter, we will use the following architecture.

![Illustration of our network architecture](images/network-001.png)

It will allow us to consider:

* integration in a LAN (local area network);
* the configuration of a gateway to reach a remote server;
* the configuration of a DNS server and the implementation of name resolution.

The minimum parameters to be defined for the machine are:

* the name of the machine;
* the IP address;
* the subnet mask.

Example:

* `pc-rocky`;
* `192.168.1.10`;
* `255.255.255.0`.

The notation called CIDR is more and more frequent: 192.168.1.10/24

IP addresses are used for the proper routing of messages (packets). They are divided into two parts:

* the fixed part, identifying the network;
* the identifier of the host in the network.

The subnet mask is a set of **4 bytes** intended to isolate:

* the network address (**NetID** or **SubnetID**) by performing a bitwise logical AND between the IP address and the mask;
* the host address (**HostID**) by performing a bitwise logical AND between the IP address and the complement of the mask.

There are also specific addresses within a network, which must be identified. The first address of a range as well as the last one have a particular role:

* The first address of a range is the **network address**. It is used to identify networks and to route information from one network to another.

* The last address of a range is the **broadcast address**. It is used to broadcast information to all the machines on the network.

### MAC address / IP address

A **MAC address** is a physical identifier written in the factory onto the device. This is sometimes referred to as the hardware address. It consists of 6 bytes often given in hexadecimal form (for example 5E:FF:56:A2:AF:15).
It is composed of: 3 bytes of the manufacturer identifier and 3 bytes of the serial number.

!!! Warning

    This last statement is nowadays a little less true with virtualization. There are also software solutions for changing the MAC address.

An Internet Protocol (**IP**) address is an identification number permanently or temporarily assigned to each device connected to a computer network using the Internet Protocol.
One part defines the network address (NetID or SubnetID as the case may be), the other part defines the address of the host in the network (HostID). The relative size of each part varies according to the network (sub)mask.

An IPv4 address defines an address on 4 bytes. The number of available addresses being close to saturation a new standard was created, the IPv6 defined on 16 bytes.

IPv6 is often represented by 8 groups of 2 bytes separated by a colon. Insignificant zeros can be omitted, one or more groups of 4 consecutive zeros can be replaced by a double colon.

Subnet masks have from 0 to 128 bits. (for example 21ac:0000:0000:0611:21e0:00ba:321b:54da/64 or 21ac::611:21e0:ba:321b:54da/64)

In a web address or URL (Uniform Resource Locator), an ip address can be followed by a colon and the port address (which indicates the application to which the data is destined). Also to avoid confusion in a URL, the IPv6 address is written in square brackets [ ], colon, port address.

IP and MAC addresses must be unique on a network!

### DNS Domain

Client machines can be part of a DNS (**Domain Name System**, e.g., `mydomain.lan`) domain.

The fully qualified machine name (**FQDN**) becomes `pc-rocky.mydomain.lan`.

A set of computers can be grouped into a logical, name-resolving, set called a DNS domain. A DNS domain is not, of course, limited to a single physical network.

In order for a computer to be part of a DNS domain, it must be given a DNS suffix (here `mydomain.lan`) as well as servers that it can query.

### Reminder of the OSI model

!!! Note "Memory aid"

    To remember the order of the layers of the OSI model, remember the following sentence: **Please Do Not Touch Steven's Pet Alligator**.

|  Layer            |  Protocols                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|  7 - Application  |  POP, IMAP, SMTP, SSH, SNMP, HTTP, FTP, ...  |
|  6 - Presentation |  ASCII, MIME, ...                            |
|  5 - Session      |  TLS, SSL, NetBIOS, ...                      |
|  4 - Transport    |  TLS, SSL, TCP, UDP, ...                     |
|  3 - Network      |  IPv4, IPv6, ARP, ...                        |
|  2 - Data Link    |  Ethernet, WiFi, Token Ring, ...             |
|  1 - Physical     |  Cables, optical fibers, radio waves, ...    |

**Layer 1** (Physical) supports transmission over a communication channel (Wifi, Optical fiber, RJ cable, etc.).
Unit: the bit.

**Layer 2** (Data Link) supports network topology
(token-ring, star, bus, etc.), data splitting and transmission errors.
Unit: the frame.

**Layer 3** (Network) supports end-to-end data transmission (IP routing = Gateway).
Unit: the packet.

**Layer 4** (Transport) supports service type (connected or unconnected)
encryption and flow control.
Unit: the segment or the datagram.

**Layer 5** (Session) supports the communication between two computers.

**Layer 6** (Presentation) represents the area that is independent of data at the application layer. Essentially this layer translates from network format to the application format, or from the application format to the network format.

**Layer 7** (Application) represents the contact with the user.
It provides the services offered by the network: http, dns, ftp, imap,
pop, smtp, etc.

## The naming of interfaces

*lo* is the "**loopback**" interface which allows TCP/IP programs to communicate with each other without leaving the local machine. This enables testing if the **network module of the system is working properly** and also allows pinging the localhost. All packets that enter through localhost leave through localhost. The packets received are the packets sent.

The Linux kernel assigns interface names with a specific prefix depending on the type. Traditionally, all **Ethernet** interfaces, for example, began with **eth**. The prefix was followed by a number, the first being 0 (eth0, eth1, eth2...). The wifi interfaces were given a wlan prefix.

On Rocky8 Linux distributions, systemd will name interfaces with the new following policy where "X" represents a number:

* `enoX`:  on-board devices
* `ensX`: PCI Express hotplug slot
* `enpXsX`: physical/geographical location of the connector of the hardware
* ...

## Using the `ip` command

Forget the old `ifconfig` command! Think `ip`!

!!! Note

    Comment for administrators of older Linux systems:

    The historical network management command is `ifconfig`. This command has been replaced by the `ip` command, which is already well known to network administrators.

    The `ip` command is the only command to manage **IP address, ARP, routing, etc.**.

    The `ifconfig` command is no longer installed by default in Rocky8.

    It is important to get into good habits now.

## The hostname

The `hostname` command displays or sets the host name of the system

```bash
hostname [-f] [hostname]
```

|  Option  |  Description                   |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| `-f`     | Displays the FQDN               |
| `-i`     | Displays the system's IP address information |

!!! Tip

    This command is used by various network programs to identify the machine.

To assign a host name, it is possible to use the `hostname` command, but the changes will not be retained at the next boot. The command with no arguments displays the host name.

To set the host name, the file `/etc/sysconfig/network` must be modified:

```bash
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=pc-rocky.mondomaine.lan
```

The RedHat boot script also consults the `/etc/hosts` file to resolve the host name of the system.

When the system boots, Linux evaluates the `HOSTNAME` value in the `/etc/sysconfig/network` file.

It then uses the `/etc/hosts` file to evaluate the main IP address of the server and its host name. It deduces the DNS domain name.

It is therefore essential to fill in these two files before any configuration of network services.

!!! Tip

    To know if this configuration is well done, the commands `hostname` and `hostname -f` must answer with the expected values.

## /etc/hosts file

The `/etc/hosts` file is a static host name mapping table, which follows the following format:

```bash
@IP <hostname>  [alias]  [# comment]
```

Example of `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.localdomain
::1             localhost localhost.localdomain
192.168.1.10    rockstar.rockylinux.lan rockstar
```

The `/etc/hosts` file is still used by the system, especially at boot time when the system FQDN is determined.

!!! Tip

    RedHat recommends that at least one line containing the system name be filled in.

If the **DNS** service (**D**omain **N**ame **S**ervice) is not in place, you must fill in all the names in the hosts file for each of your machines.

The `/etc/hosts` file contains one line per entry, with the IP address, the FQDN, then the host name (in that order) and a series of aliases (alias1 alias2 ...). The alias is an option.

## `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file

The **NSS** (**N**ame **S**ervice **S**witch) allows configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, `/etc/hosts`) to be substituted for one or more centralized databases.

The `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file is used to configure the name service databases.

```bash
passwd: files
shadow: files
group: files

hosts: files dns
```

In this case, Linux will first look for a host name match (`hosts:` line) in the `/etc/hosts` file (`files` value) before querying DNS (`dns` value)! This behavior can simply be changed by editing the `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file.

Of course, it is possible to imagine querying an LDAP, MySQL or other server by configuring the name service to respond to system requests for hosts, users, groups, etc.

The resolution of the name service can be tested with the `getent` command that we will see later in this course.

## `/etc/resolv.conf` file

The `/etc/resolv.conf` file contains the DNS name resolution configuration.

```bash
#Generated by NetworkManager
domain mondomaine.lan
search mondomaine.lan
nameserver 192.168.1.254
```

!!! Tip

    This file is historical. It is no longer filled in directly!

Newer generations of distributions have generally integrated the `NetworkManager` service. This service allows you to manage the configuration more efficiently, either in graphical or console mode.

It allows for the addition of DNS servers from the configuration file of a network interface. It then dynamically populates the `/etc/resolv.conf` file which should never be edited directly, otherwise the configuration changes will be lost the next time the network service is started.

## `ip` command

The `ip` command from the `iproute2` package allows you to configure an interface and its routing table.

Display interfaces:

```bash
[root]# ip link
```

Display interfaces information:

```bash
[root]# ip addr show
```

Display the information of an interface:

```bash
[root]# ip addr show eth0
```

Display the ARP table:

```bash
[root]# ip neigh
```

All historical network management commands have been grouped under the `ip` command, which is well known to network administrators.

## DHCP configuration

The **DHCP** protocol (**D**ynamic **H**ost **C**ontrol **P**rotocol) allows you to obtain a complete IP configuration via the network. This is the default configuration mode of a network interface under Rocky Linux, which explains why a system connected to the network of an Internet router can function without additional configuration.

The configuration of interfaces under Rocky Linux is done in the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` folder.

For each Ethernet interface, a `ifcfg-ethX` file allows for the configuration of the associated interface.

```bash
DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
HWADDR=00:0c:29:96:32:e3
```

* Interface name: (must be in the file name)

```bash
DEVICE=eth0
```

* Automatically start the interface:

```bash
ONBOOT=yes
```

* Make a DHCP request when the interface starts up:

```bash
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
```

* Specify the MAC address (optional but useful when there are several interfaces):

```bash
HWADDR=00:0c:29:96:32:e3
```

!!! Tip

    If NetworkManager is installed, the changes are taken into account automatically. If not, you have to restart the network service.

* Restart the network service:

```bash
[root]# systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

## Static configuration

The static configuration requires at least:

```bash
DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
IPADDR=192.168.1.10
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
```

* Here we are replacing "dhcp" with "none" which equals static configuration:

```bash
BOOTPROTO=none
```

* IP Address:

```bash
IPADDR=192.168.1.10
```

* Subnet mask:

```bash
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
```

* The mask can be specified with a prefix:

```bash
PREFIX=24
```

!!! Warning

    You must use NETMASK OR PREFIX - Not both!

## Routing

![Network architecture with a gateway](images/network-002.png)

```bash
DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
HWADDR=00:0c:29:96:32:e3
IPADDR=192.168.1.10
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.254
```

The `ip route` command:

```bash
[root]# ip route show
192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 […] src 192.168.1.10 metric 1
default via 192.168.1.254 dev eth0 proto static
```

It is a good idea to know how to read a routing table, especially in an environment with multiple network interfaces.

* In the example shown, the `192.168.1.0/24` network is reachable directly from the `eth0` device, so there is a metric at `1` (does not traverse a router).

* All other networks than the previous one will be reachable, again from the `eth0` device, but this time the packets will be addressed to a `192.168.1.254` gateway. The routing protocol is a static protocol (although it is possible to add a route to a dynamically assigned address in Linux).

## Name resolution

A system needs to resolve:

* FQDNs into IP addresses

```bash
www.free.fr = 212.27.48.10
```

* IP addresses into names

```bash
212.27.48.10 = www.free.fr
```

* or to obtain information about an area:

```bash
MX de free.fr = 10 mx1.free.fr + 20 mx2.free.fr
```

```bash
DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
HWADDR=00:0c:29:96:32:e3
IPADDR=192.168.1.10
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.254
DNS1=172.16.1.2
DNS2=172.16.1.3
DOMAIN=rockylinux.lan
```

In this case, to reach the DNS, you have to go through the gateway.

```bash
 #Generated by NetworkManager
 domain mondomaine.lan
 search mondomaine.lan
 nameserver 172.16.1.2
 nameserver 172.16.1.3
```

The file has been updated by NetworkManager.

## Troubleshooting

The `ping` command sends datagrams to another machine and waits for a response.

It is the basic command for testing the network because it checks the connectivity between your network interface and another.

Syntax of the `ping` command:

```bash
ping [-c numerical] destination
```

The `-c` (count) option allows you to stop the command after the countdown in seconds.

Example:

```bash
[root]# ping –c 4 localhost
```

!!! Tip

    Validate connectivity from near to far

1. Validate the TCP/IP software layer

    ```bash
    [root]# ping localhost
    ```

    "Pinging" the inner loop does not detect a hardware failure on the network interface. It simply determines whether the IP software configuration is correct.

2. Validate the network card

    ```bash
    [root]# ping 192.168.1.10
    ```

    To determine the functionality of the network card, we must ping its IP address. If the network cable is not connected to the network card, it should be in a "down" state.

    If the ping does not work, first check the network cable to your network switch and reassemble the interface (see the `if up` command), then check the interface itself.

3. Validate the connectivity of the gateway

    ```bash
    [root]# ping 192.168.1.254
    ```

4. Validate the connectivity of a remote server

    ```bash
    [root]# ping 172.16.1.2
    ```

5. Validate the DNS service

    ```bash
    [root]# ping www.free.fr
    ```

### `dig` command

The `dig` command is used to query the DNS server.

The `dig` command syntax:

```bash
dig [-t type] [+short] [name]
```

Examples:

```bash
[root]# dig +short rockylinux.org
76.223.126.88
[root]# dig -t MX +short rockylinux.org                                                          ✔
5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.
...
```

The `dig` command is used to query DNS servers. It is verbose by default, but the `+short` option can change this behavior.

It is also possible to specify a DNS **record type** to resolve, such as an MX **type** to get information about the mail exchangers for a domain.

### `getent` command

The `getent` (get entry) command gets an NSSwitch entry (`hosts` + `dns`)

Syntax of the `getent` command:

```bash
getent hosts name
```

Example:

```bash
[root]# getent hosts rockylinux.org
  76.223.126.88 rockylinux.org
```

Querying only a DNS server may return an erroneous result that does not consider the contents of a `hosts` file, although this should be rare nowadays.

To take the `/etc/hosts` file into account, the NSSwitch name service must be queried, which will take care of any DNS resolution.

### `ipcalc` command

The `ipcalc` (**ip calculation**) command calculates the address of a network or broadcast from an IP address and a mask.

Syntax of the `ipcalc` command:

```bash
ipcalc  [options] IP <netmask>
```

Example:

```bash
[root]# ipcalc –b 172.16.66.203 255.255.240.0
BROADCAST=172.16.79.255
```

!!! Tip

    This command is interesting, followed by a redirection to fill in the configuration files of your interfaces automatically:

    ```
    [root]# ipcalc –b 172.16.66.203 255.255.240.0 >> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
    ```

|  Option  |  Description                           |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
|  `-b`    | Displays the broadcast address.        |
|  `-n`    | Displays the network address and mask. |

`ipcalc` is a simple way to calculate a host's IP information. The various options indicate what information `ipcalc` should display on the standard output. You can specify multiple options. You must specify an IP address on which to operate. Most operations also require a network mask or CIDR prefix.

| Option short | Option long | Description                                                                  |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-b`          | `--broadcast` | Displays the broadcast address of the given IP address and the network mask. |
| `-h`          | `--hostname`  | Displays the hostname of the IP address given via DNS.                       |
| `-n`          | `--netmask`   | Calculates the network mask for the given IP address. Assumes that the IP address is part of a complete class A, B, or C network. Many networks do not use default network masks, in which case an incorrect value will be returned. |
| `-p`          | `--prefix`    | Indicates the prefix of the mask/IP address.                                 |
| `-n`          | `--network`   | Indicates the network address of the given IP address and mask.              |
| `-s`          | `--silent`    | Does not display any error messages.                                           |

### `ss` command

The `ss` (**socket statistics**) command displays the listening ports on the network.

Syntax of the `ss` command:

```bash
ss [-tuna]
```

Example:

```bash
[root]# ss –tuna
tcp   LISTEN   0   128   *:22   *:*
```

The commands `ss` and `netstat` (to follow) will be very important for the rest of your Linux life.

When implementing network services, it is common to check with one of these two commands that the service is listening on the expected ports.

### `netstat` command

!!! Warning

    The `netstat` command is now deprecated and is no longer installed by default on Rocky Linux. You may still find some Linux versions that have it installed, but it is best to move on to using `ss` for everything that you would have used `netstat` for.

The `netstat` command (**network statistics**) displays the listening ports on the network.

Syntax of the `netstat` command:

```bash
netstat -tapn
```

Example:

```bash
[root]# netstat –tapn
tcp  0  0  0.0.0.0:22  0.0.0.0:*  LISTEN 2161/sshd
```

### IP or MAC address conflicts

A misconfiguration can cause multiple interfaces to use the same IP address. This can happen when a network has multiple DHCP servers, or the same IP address is manually assigned numerous times.

When the network is malfunctioning, and when an IP address conflict could be the cause, it is possible to use the `arp-scan` software (requires the EPEL repository):

```bash
dnf install arp-scan
```

Example:

```bash
$ arp-scan -I eth0 -l

172.16.1.104  00:01:02:03:04:05       3COM CORPORATION
172.16.1.107  00:0c:29:1b:eb:97       VMware, Inc.
172.16.1.250  00:26:ab:b1:b7:f6       (Unknown)
172.16.1.252  00:50:56:a9:6a:ed       VMWare, Inc.
172.16.1.253  00:50:56:b6:78:ec       VMWare, Inc.
172.16.1.253  00:50:56:b6:78:ec       VMWare, Inc. (DUP: 2)
172.16.1.253  00:50:56:b6:78:ec       VMWare, Inc. (DUP: 3)
172.16.1.253  00:50:56:b6:78:ec       VMWare, Inc. (DUP: 4)
172.16.1.232  88:51:fb:5e:fa:b3       (Unknown) (DUP: 2)
```

!!! Tip

    As the above example shows, MAC address conflicts are possible! Virtualization technologies and the copying of virtual machines cause these problems.

## Hot configuration

The `ip` command can hot add an IP address to an interface.

```bash
ip addr add @IP dev DEVICE
```

Example:

```bash
[root]# ip addr add 192.168.2.10 dev eth1
```

The `ip` command allows for the activation or deactivation of an interface:

```bash
ip link set DEVICE up
ip link set DEVICE down
```

Example:

```bash
[root]# ip link set eth1 up
[root]# ip link set eth1 down
```

The `ip` command adds a route:

```bash
ip route add [default|netaddr] via @IP [dev device]
```

Example:

```bash
[root]# ip route add default via 192.168.1.254
[root]# ip route add 192.168.100.0/24 via 192.168.2.254 dev eth1
```

## In summary

The files used in this chapter are:

![Synthesis of the files implemented in the network part](images/network-003.png)

A complete interface configuration could be this (file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`):

```bash
 DEVICE=eth0
 ONBOOT=yes
 BOOTPROTO=none
 HWADDR=00:0c:29:96:32:e3
 IPADDR=192.168.1.10
 NETMASK=255.255.255.0
 GATEWAY=192.168.1.254
 DNS1=172.16.1.1
 DNS2=172.16.1.2
 DOMAIN=rockylinux.lan
```

The troubleshooting method should go from closest to farthest:

1. ping localhost (software test)
2. ping IP-address (hardware test)
3. ping gateway (connectivity test)
4. ping remote server (routing test)
5. DNS query (dig or ping)

![Method of troubleshooting or network validation](images/network-004.png)
