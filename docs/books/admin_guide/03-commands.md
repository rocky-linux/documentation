## Generalities

Current Linux systems have graphical utilities dedicated to the work of an administrator. However, it is important to be able to use the interface in command line mode for several reasons:

* The majority of system commands are common to all Linux distributions, which is not the case for graphical tools.
* It can happen that the system does not start correctly but that a backup command interpreter remains accessible.
* Remote administration is done on the command line with an SSH terminal.
* In order to preserve server resources, the graphical interface is either not installed or launched on demand.
* Administration is done by scripts.

Learning these commands allows the administrator to connect to a Linux terminal, to manage its resources and files, to identify the station, the terminal, and the connected users, etc.

### The users

The user of a Linux system will be defined in the `/etc/passwd` file, by:

* A **login name**, more commonly called "login", containing no spaces.
* A numeric identifier: **UID** (User Identifier).
* A group identifier: **GID** (Group Identifier).
* A **command interpreter**, e.g., a shell, which can be different from one user to another.
* A **connection directory**, e.g., the **home directory**.

In other files the user will be defined by:

* A **password**, which is encrypted before being stored (`/etc/shadow`).
* A **command prompt**, or **prompt** login, which is symbolized by a
  
    * `#` for administrators
    * and a `$` for other users (`/etc/profile`).

Depending on the security policy implemented on the system, the password will require a certain number of characters and meet certain complexity requirements.

Among the existing command interpreters, the **Bourne-Again Shell** (`/bin/bash`) is the one most frequently used. It is assigned by default to new users. For various reasons, advanced Linux users can choose alternative shells such as the Korn Shell (`ksh`), the C Shell (`csh`), etc.

The user's login directory is by convention stored in the `/home` directory of the workstation. It will contain the user's personal data and the configuration files of his applications. By default, at login, the login directory is selected as the current directory.

A workstation-type installation (with graphical interface) starts this interface on terminal 1. Linux being multi-user, it is possible to connect several users several times, on different **physical terminals** (TTY) or **virtual terminals** (PTS). Virtual terminals are available within a graphical environment. A user switches from one physical terminal to another using  ++alt+"Fx"++ from the command line or using ++ctrl+alt+"Fx"++.

### The shell

Once the user is connected to a console, the shell displays the **command prompt**. It then behaves like an infinite loop, repeating the same pattern with each statement entered:

* Displays the command prompt.
* Reads the command.
* Analyzes the syntax.
* Substitutes special characters.
* Executes the command.
* Displays the command prompt.
* Etc.

The key sequence ++ctrl+c++ is used to interrupt a running command.

The use of a command generally follows this sequence:

```bash
command [option(s)] [argument(s)]
```

The name of the command is often **lower case**.

A space separates each item.

**Short options** begin with a dash (`-l`), while **long options** begin with two dashes (`--list`).
A double dash (`--`) indicates the end of the option list.

It is possible to group some short options together:

```bash
ls -l -i -a
```

is equivalent to:

```bash
ls -lia
```

There can be several arguments after an option:

```bash
ls -lia /etc /home /var
```

In the literature, the term "option" is equivalent to the term "parameter," which is more commonly used in programming. The optional side of an option or argument is symbolized by enclosing it in square brackets `[` and `]`. When more than one option is possible, a vertical bar called a "pipe" separates them `[a|e|i]`.

## General commands

### `apropos`, `whatis` and `man` commands

It is impossible for an administrator at any level to know all the commands and options in detail. A manual is usually available for all installed commands.

#### `apropos` command

The command `apropos` allows you to search by keyword within these manual pages:

| Options                                     | Description                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-s`, `--sections list` or `--section list` | Limited to manual sections.                                |
| `-a` or `--and`                             | Displays only the item matching all the provided keywords. |

Example:

```bash
$ apropos clear
clear (1)            - clear the terminal screen
clear_console (1)    - clear the console
clearenv (3)         - clear the environment
clearerr (3)         - check and reset stream status
clearerr_unlocked (3) - nonlocking stdio functions
feclearexcept (3)    - floating-point rounding and exception handling
fwup_clear_status (3) - library to support management of system firmware updates
klogctl (3)          - read and/or clear kernel message ring buffer; set console_loglevel
sgt-samegame (6)     - block-clearing puzzle
syslog (2)           - read and/or clear kernel message ring buffer; set console_loglevel
timerclear (3)       - timeval operations
XClearArea (3)       - clear area or window
XClearWindow (3)     - clear area or window
XSelectionClearEvent (3) - SelectionClear event structure
```

To find the command that will allow changing the password of an account:

```bash
$ apropos --exact password  -a change
chage (1)            - change user password expiry information
passwd (1)           - change user password
```

#### `whatis` command

The `whatis` command displays the description of the command passed as argument:

```bash
whatis clear
```

Example:

```bash
$ whatis clear
clear (1)            - clear the terminal screen
```

#### `man` command

Once found by `apropos` or `whatis`, the manual is read by `man` ("Man is your friend").
This set of manuals is divided into 8 sections, grouping information by topic, the default section being 1:

1. Executable programs or commands.
2. System calls (functions given by the kernel).
3. Library calls (functions given by the library).
4. Special files (usually found in /dev).
5. File Formats and conventions (configuration files such as etc/passwd).
6. Games (such as character-based applications).
7. Miscellaneous (e.g. man (7)).
8. System administration commands (usually only for root).
9. Kernel routines (non-standard).

Information about each section can be accessed by typing `man x intro`, where `x` is the section number.

The command:

```bash
man passwd
```

will tell the administrator about the passwd command, its options, etc. While a:

```bash
man 5 passwd
```

will inform him about the files related to the command.

Navigate through the manual with the arrows ++arrow-up++ and ++arrow-down++. Exit the manual by pressing the ++q++ key.

### `shutdown` command

The `shutdown` command allows you to **electronically shut down** a Linux server, either immediately or after a certain period of time.

```bash
shutdown [-h] [-r] time [message]
```

Specify the shutdown time in the format `hh:mm` for a precise time, or `+mm` for a delay in minutes.

To force an immediate stop, use the word `now` in place of the time. In this case, the optional message is not sent to other users of the system.

Examples:

```bash
[root]# shutdown -h 0:30 "Server shutdown at 0:30"
[root]# shutdown -r +5
```

Options:

| Options | Remarks                          |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `-h`    | Shuts down the system electronically. |
| `-r`    | Restarts the system.              |

### `history` command

The `history` command displays the history of commands that have been entered by the user.

The commands are stored in the `.bash_history` file in the user's login directory.

Example of a history command

```bash
$ history
147 man ls
148 man history
```

| Options | Comments                                                                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-w`    | Writes the current history to the history file.                                                |
| `-c`    | Deletes the history of the current session (but not the contents of the `.bash_history` file). |

* Manipulating history:

To manipulate the history, the following commands entered from the command prompt will:

| Keys               | Function                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ++exclam+exclam++      | Recalls the last command placed.                           |
| ++exclam+n++      | Recalls the command by its number in the list.             |
| ++exclam+"string"++ | Recalls the most recent command beginning with the string. |
| ++arrow-up++       | Navigates through your history working backward in time from the most recent command. |
| ++arrow-down++       | Navigates through your history working forward in time. |

### Auto-complete

Auto-completion is a great help.

* Completes commands, entered paths, or file names.
* Press the ++tab++ key to complete the entry in the case of a single solution.
* In the case of multiple solutions, press ++tab++ a second time to see options.

If double-pressing the ++tab++ key presents no options, then there is no solution to the current completion.

## Display and Identification

### `clear` command

The `clear` command clears the contents of the terminal screen. More accurately, it shifts the display so that the command prompt is at the top of the screen on the first line.

On a physical terminal, the display will be permanently hidden, whereas in a graphical interface, a scrollbar will allow you to go back in the history of the virtual terminal.

!!! Tip

    ++control+l++ will have the same effect as the `clear` command

### `echo` command

The `echo` command is used to display a string of characters.

This command is most commonly used in administration scripts to inform the user during execution.

The `-n` option indicates no newline output string (by default, newline output string).

```bash
shell > echo -n "123";echo "456"
123456

shell > echo "123";echo "456"
123
456
```

For various reasons, the script developer may need to use special sequences (starting with a `\` character). In this case, the `-e` option will be stipulated, allowing interpretation of the sequences.

Among the frequently used sequences, we can mention:

| Sequence | Result                |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| `\a`     | Sends a sonar beep      |
| `\b`     | Back                  |
| `\n`     | Adds a line break     |
| `\t`     | Adds a horizontal tab |
| `\v`     | Adds a vertical tab     |

### `date` command

The `date` command displays the date and time. The command has the following syntax:

```bash
date [-d yyyyMMdd] [format]
```

Examples:

```bash
$ date
Mon May 24 16:46:53 CEST 2021
$ date -d 20210517 +%j
137
```

In this last example, the `-d` option displays a given date. The `+%j` option formats this date to show only the day of the year.

!!! Warning

    The format of a date can change depending on the value of the language defined in the environment variable `$LANG`.

The date display can follow the following formats:

| Option  | Format                                                    |
| --------| --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+%A`   | Locale's full weekday name (e.g., Sunday)                 |
| `+%B`   | Locale's full month name (e.g., January)                  |
| `+%c`   | Locale's date and time (e.g., Thu Mar  3 23:05:25 2005)   |
| `+%d`   | Day of month (e.g., 01)                                   |
| `+%F`   | Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format                               |
| `+%G`   | Year                                                      |
| `+%H`   | Hour (00..23)                                             |
| `+%j`   | Day of the year (001..366)                                |
| `+%m`   | Month number (01..12)                                     |
| `+%M`   | Minute  (00..59)                                          |
| `+%R`   | Time in `hh:mm` format                                    |
| `+%s`   | Seconds since January 1, 1970                             |
| `+%S`   | Second (00..60)                                           |
| `+%T`   | Time in `hh:mm:ss` format                                 |
| `+%u`   | Day of the week (`1` for Monday)                          |
| `+%V`   | Week number (`+%V`)                                       |
| `+%x`   | Date in format `DD/MM/YYYY`                               |

The `date` command also allows you to change the system date and time. In this case, the `-s` option will be used.

```bash
[root]# date -s "2021-05-24 10:19"
```

The format to be used following the `-s` option is this:

```bash
date -s "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm[:ss]"
```

### `id`, `who` and `whoami` commands

The `id` command is used to display information about users and groups. By default, no user parameter is added, and the information of the currently logged in user and group is displayed。

```bash
$ id rockstar
uid=1000(rockstar) gid=1000(rockstar) groups=1000(rockstar),10(wheel)
```

The `-g`, `-G`, `-n` and `-u` options display the main group GID, subgroup GIDs, names instead of numeric identifiers, and the user's UID respectively.

The `whoami` command displays the login of the current user.

The `who` command alone displays the names of logged in users:

```bash
$ who
rockstar tty1   2021-05-24 10:30
root     pts/0  2021-05-24 10:31
```

Since Linux is multi-user, it is possible that multiple sessions are open on the same station, either physically or over the network. It is interesting to know which users are logged in, if only to communicate with them by sending messages.

* tty: represents a terminal.
* pts/: represents a virtual console in a graphical environment with the number after representing the instance of the virtual console (0, 1, 2...)

The `-r` option also displays the runlevel (see chapter "startup").

## File Tree

In Linux, the file tree is an inverted tree, called a **single hierarchical tree**, whose root is the directory `/`.

The **current directory** is the directory where the user is located.

The **connection directory** is the working directory associated with the user. The login directories are, by default, stored in the `/home` directory.

When the user logs in, the current directory is the login directory.

An **absolute path** references a file from the root by traversing the entire tree to the file level:

* `/home/groupA/alice/file`

The **relative path** references that same file by traversing the entire tree from the current directory:

* `../alice/file`

In the above example, the "`..`" refers to the parent directory of the current directory.

A directory, even if it is empty, will necessarily contain at least **two references**:

* `.`: reference to itself.
* `..`: reference to the parent directory of the current directory.

A relative path can thus start with `./` or `../`. When the relative path refers to a subdirectory or file in the current directory, then the `./` is often omitted. Mentioning the first `./` in the tree will only really be required to run an executable file.

Errors in paths can cause many problems: creating folders or files in the wrong places, unintentional deletions, etc. It is therefore strongly recommended to use auto-completion when entering paths.

![our example tree](images/commands-pathabsolute.png)

In the above example, we are looking to give the location of the file `myfile` from the directory of bob.

* By an **absolute path**, the current directory does not matter. We start at the root, and work our way down to the directories `home`, `groupA`, `alice` and finally the file `myfile`: `/home/groupA/alice/myfile`.
* By a **relative path**, our starting point being the current directory `bob`, we go up one level through `..` (i.e., into the `groupA` directory), then down into the alice directory, and finally the `myfile` file: `../alice/myfile`.

### `pwd` command

The `pwd` (Print Working Directory) command displays the absolute path of the current directory.

```bash
$ pwd
/home/rockstar
```

To use a relative path to reference a file or directory, or use the `cd` command to move to another directory, you must know its location in the file tree.

Depending on the type of shell and the different parameters of its configuration file, the terminal prompt (also known as the command prompt) will display the absolute or relative path of the current directory.

### `cd` command

The `cd` (Change Directory) command allows you to change the current directory -- in other words, to move through the tree.

```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ pwd
/tmp
$ cd ../
$ pwd
/
$ cd
$ pwd
/home/rockstar
```

As you can see in the last example above, the command `cd` with no arguments moves the current directory to the `home directory`.

### `ls` command

The `ls` command displays the contents of a directory.

```bash
ls [-a] [-i] [-l] [directory1] [directory2] […]
```

Example:

```bash
$ ls /home
.    ..    rockstar
```

The main options of the `ls` command are:

| Option                                                       | Information                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-a`                                                         | Displays all files, even hidden ones. Hidden files in Linux are those beginning with `.`.                                            |
| `-i`                                                         | Displays inode numbers.                                                                                                              |
| `-l`                                                         | Use a long listing format, that is, each line displays long format information for a file or directory.                                 |

The `ls` command, however, has a lot of options (see `man`):

| Option                                                       | Information                                                                                                                          |
| ------                                                       | ------------                                                                                                                         |
| `-d`                                                         | Displays information about a directory instead of listing its contents.                                                              |
| `-g`                                                         | Like -l option, but do not list owner.                                                                                               |
| `-h`                                                         | Displays file sizes in the most appropriate format (byte, kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, ...). `h` stands for Human Readable. Needs to be used with -l option.         |
| `-s`                                                         | Displays the allocated size of each file, in blocks. In the `ls` command, the default size of a single block is 1024-Byte. In the GNU/Linux operating system, "block" is the smallest unit of storage in the file system, and generally speaking, one block is equal to 4096-Byte. In the Windows operating system, taking the NTFS file system as an example, its smallest storage unit is called a "Cluster". The definition of the minimum storage unit name may vary depending on different file systems. |
| `-A`                                                         | Displays all files in the directory except `.` and `..`                                                                              |
| `-R`                                                         | Displays the contents of subdirectories recursively.                                                                                 |
| `-F`                                                         | Displays the type of files. Prints a `/` for a directory, `*` for executables, `@` for a symbolic link, and nothing for a text file. |
| `-X`                                                         | Sorts files according to their extensions.                                                                                           |

* Description of columns generated by running the `ls -lia` command:

```bash
$ ls -lia /home
78489 drwx------ 4 rockstar rockstar 4096 25 oct. 08:10 rockstar
```

| Value           | Information                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `78489`         | Inode Number.                                                                                                 |
| `drwx------`    | File type (`d`) and rights (`rwx------`).                                                                     |
| `4`             | Number of subdirectories (`.` and `..` included). For a file, it represents the number of hard links, and 1 represents itself. |
| `rockstar`      | User ownership.                                                                                               |
| `rockstar`      | Group ownership.                                                                                              |
| `4096`          | For files, it shows the size of the file. For directories, it shows the fixed value of 4096 bytes occupied by the file naming. To calculate the total size of a directory, use `du -sh rockstar/` |
| `25 oct. 08:10` | Last modified date.                                                                                           |
| `rockstar`      | The name of the file (or directory).                                                                          |

!!! Note

    **Aliases** are frequently positioned in common distributions.

    This is the case of the alias `ll`:

    ```
    alias ll='ls -l --color=auto'
    ```

The `ls` command has many options. Here are some advanced examples of uses:

* List the files in `/etc` in order of last modification:

```bash
$ ls -ltr /etc
total 1332
-rw-r--r--.  1 root root    662 29 may   2021 logrotate.conf
-rw-r--r--.  1 root root    272 17 may.   2021 mailcap
-rw-------.  1 root root    122 12 may.  2021 securetty
...
-rw-r--r--.  2 root root     85 18 may.  17:04 resolv.conf
-rw-r--r--.  1 root root     44 18 may.  17:04 adjtime
-rw-r--r--.  1 root root    283 18 may.  17:05 mtab
```

* List `/var` files larger than 1 megabyte but less than 1 gigabyte. The example here uses advanced `grep` commands with regular expressions. Novices don't have to struggle too much, there will be a special tutorial to introduce these regular expressions in the future.

```bash
$ ls -lhR /var/ | grep ^\- | grep -E "[1-9]*\.[0-9]*M" 
...
-rw-r--r--. 1 apache apache 1.2M 10 may.  13:02 XB RiyazBdIt.ttf
-rw-r--r--. 1 apache apache 1.2M 10 may.  13:02 XB RiyazBd.ttf
-rw-r--r--. 1 apache apache 1.1M 10 may.  13:02 XB RiyazIt.ttf
...
```

Of course, we highly recommend that you use the `find` command.

```bash
find /var -size +1M -a -size -1024M  -a -type f  -exec ls -lh {} \;
```

* Show the rights on a folder:

To find out the rights to a folder, in our example `/etc`, the following command would **not** be appropriate:

```bash
$ ls -l /etc
total 1332
-rw-r--r--.  1 root root     44 18 nov.  17:04 adjtime
-rw-r--r--.  1 root root   1512 12 janv.  2010 aliases
-rw-r--r--.  1 root root  12288 17 nov.  17:41 aliases.db
drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   4096 17 nov.  17:48 alternatives
...
```

The above command will display the contents of the folder (inside) by default. For the folder itself, you can use the `-d` option.

```bash
ls -ld /etc
drwxr-xr-x. 69 root root 4096 18 nov.  17:05 /etc
```

* Sort by file size, largest first:

```bash
ls -lhS
```

* time/date format with `-l`:

```bash
$ ls -l --time-style="+%Y-%m-%d %m-%d %H:%M" /
total 12378
dr-xr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 2014-11-23 11-23 03:13 bin
dr-xr-xr-x. 5 root root 1024 2014-11-23 11-23 05:29 boot
```

* Add the _trailing slash_ to the end of folders:

By default, the `ls` command does not display the last slash of a folder.
In some cases, like for scripts for example, it is useful to display them:

```bash
$ ls -dF /etc
/etc/
```

* Hide some extensions:

```bash
ls /etc --hide=*.conf
```

### `mkdir` command

The `mkdir` command creates a directory or directory tree.

```bash
mkdir [-p] directory [directory] [...]
```

Example:

```bash
mkdir /home/rockstar/work
```

The "rockstar" directory must exist to create the "work" directory.

Otherwise, the `-p` option should be used. The `-p` option creates the parent directories if they do not exist.

!!! Danger

    It is not recommended to use Linux command names as directory or file names.

### `touch` command

The `touch` command changes the timestamp of a file or creates an empty file if the file does not exist.

```bash
touch [-t date] file
```

Example:

```bash
touch /home/rockstar/myfile
```

| Option                            | Information                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-t date`                         | Changes the date of last modification of the file with the specified date. |

Date format: `[AAAA]MMJJhhmm[ss]`

!!! Tip

    The `touch` command is primarily used to create an empty file, but it can be useful for incremental or differential backups for example. Indeed, the only effect of executing a `touch` on a file will be to force it to be saved during the next backup.

### `rmdir` command

The `rmdir` command deletes an empty directory.

Example:

```bash
rmdir /home/rockstar/work
```

| Option                                                                  | Information |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `-p` |  Removes the parent directory or directories provided if they are empty.           |

!!! Tip

    To delete both a non-empty directory and its contents, use the `rm` command.

### `rm` command

The `rm` command deletes a file or directory.

```bash
rm [-f] [-r] file [file] [...]
```

!!! Danger

    Any deletion of a file or directory is final.

| Options | Information                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `-f`    | Do not ask whether to delete. |
| `-i`    | Ask whether to delete.       |
| `-r`    | Delete a directory and recursively delete its subdirectories.      |

!!! Note

    The `rm` command itself does not ask for confirmation when deleting files. However, with a Red Hat/Rocky distribution, `rm` does ask for confirmation of deletion because the `rm` command is an `alias` of the `rm -i` command. Don't be surprised if on another distribution, like Debian for example, you don't get a confirmation request.

Deleting a folder with the `rm` command, whether the folder is empty or not, will require the `-r` option to be added.

The end of the options is signaled to the shell by a double dash `--`.

In the example:

```bash
$ >-hard-hard # To create an empty file called -hard-hard
hard-hard
[CTRL+C] To interrupt the creation of the file
$ rm -f -- -hard-hard
```

The hard-hard file name starts with a `-`. Without the use of the `--` the shell would have interpreted the `-d` in `-hard-hard` as an option.

### `mv` command

The `mv` command moves and renames a file.

```bash
mv file [file ...] destination
```

Examples:

```bash
mv /home/rockstar/file1 /home/rockstar/file2

mv /home/rockstar/file1 /home/rockstar/file2 /tmp
```

| Options                                                                        | Information                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f`                                                                           | Don't ask for confirmation if overwriting the destination file. |
| `-i`                                                                           | Request confirmation if overwriting destination file (default). |

A few concrete cases will help you understand the difficulties that can arise:

```bash
mv /home/rockstar/file1 /home/rockstar/file2
```

Renames `file1` to `file2`. If `file2` already exists, replace the contents of the file with `file1`.

```bash
mv /home/rockstar/file1 /home/rockstar/file2 /tmp
```

Moves `file1` and `file2` into the `/tmp` directory.

```bash
mv file1 /repexist/file2
```

Moves `file1` into `repexist` and renames it `file2`.

```bash
mv file1 file2
```

`file1` is renamed to `file2`.

```bash
mv file1 /repexist
```

If the destination directory exists, `file1` is moved to `/repexist`.

```bash
mv file1 /wrongrep
```

If the destination directory does not exist, `file1` is renamed to `wrongrep` in the root directory.

### `cp` command

The `cp` command copies a file.

```bash
cp file [file ...] destination
```

Example:

```bash
cp -r /home/rockstar /tmp
```

| Options | Information                                                      |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-i`    | Request confirmation if overwriting (default).                   |
| `-f`    | Do not ask for confirmation if overwriting the destination file. |
| `-p`    | Keeps the owner, permissions and timestamp of the copied file.   |
| `-r`    | Copies a directory with its files and subdirectories.            |
| `-s`    | Creates a symbolic link rather than copying.                    |

```bash
cp file1 /repexist/file2
```

`file1` is copied to `/repexist` under the name `file2`.

```bash
cp file1 file2
```

`file1` is copied as `file2` to this directory.

```bash
cp file1 /repexist
```

If the destination directory exists, `file1` is copied to `/repexist`.

```bash
cp file1 /wrongrep
```

If the destination directory does not exist, `file1` is copied under the name `wrongrep` to the root directory.

## Visualization

### `file` command

The `file` command displays the type of a file.

```bash
file file1 [files]
```

Example:

```bash
$ file /etc/passwd /etc
/etc/passwd:    ASCII text
/etc:        directory
```

### `more` command

The `more` command displays the contents of one or more files screen by screen.

```bash
more file1 [files]
```

Example:

```bash
$ more /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
...
```

Using the ++enter++ key, the move is line by line. Using the ++space++ key, the move is page by page. `/text` allows you to search for the occurrence in the file.

### `less` command

The `less` command displays the contents of one or more files. The `less` command is interactive and has its own commands for use.

```bash
less file1 [files]
```

The commands specific to `less` are:

| Command           | Action                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ++h++               | Help.                                           |
| ++arrow-up++ ++arrow-down++ ++arrow-right++ ++arrow-left++         | Move up, down a line, or to the right or left.  |
| ++enter++           | Move down one line.                             |
| ++space++           | Move down one page.                             |
| ++page-up++ and ++page-down++ | Move up or down one page.                       |
| ++"g"++ and ++g++ | Move to the first and last pages         |
| `/text`           | Search for text.                                |
| ++q++               | Quit the `less` command.                        |

### `cat` command

The `cat` command concatenates the contents of multiple files and displays the result on the standard output.

```bash
cat file1 [files]
```

Example 1 - Displaying the contents of a file to the standard output:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

Example 2 - Displaying the contents of multiple files to standard output:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd /etc/group
```

Example 3 - Combining the contents of multiple files into one file using output redirection:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd /etc/group > usersAndGroups.txt
```

Example 4 - Displaying the line numbering:

```bash
$ cat -n /etc/profile
     1    # /etc/profile: system-wide .profile file for the Bourne shell (sh(1))
     2    # and Bourne compatible shells (bash(1), ksh(1), ash(1), ...).
     3
     4    if [ "`id -u`" -eq 0 ]; then
     5      PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
     6    else
…
```

Example 5 - Shows the numbering of non-empty lines:

```bash
$ cat -b /etc/profile
     1    # /etc/profile: system-wide .profile file for the Bourne shell (sh(1))
     2    # and Bourne compatible shells (bash(1), ksh(1), ash(1), ...).

     3    if [ "`id -u`" -eq 0 ]; then
     4      PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
     5    else
…
```

### `tac` command

The `tac` command does almost the opposite of the `cat` command. It displays the contents of a file starting from the end (which is particularly interesting for reading logs!).

Example: Display a log file by displaying the last line first:

```bash
[root]# tac /var/log/messages | less
```

### `head` command

The `head` command displays the beginning of a file.

```bash
head [-n x] file
```

| Option                                                                                                | Description                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `-n x`                                                                                                | Display the first `x` lines of the file |

By default (without the `-n` option), the `head` command will display the first 10 lines of the file.

### `tail` command

The `tail` command displays the end of a file.

```bash
tail [-f] [-n x] file
```

| Option   | Description                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `-n x`   | Displays the last `x` lines of the file   |
| `-f`     | Displays changes to the file in real time |

Example:

```bash
tail -n 3 /etc/passwd
sshd:x:74:74:Privilege-separeted sshd:/var/empty /sshd:/sbin/nologin
tcpdump::x:72:72::/:/sbin/nologin
user1:x:500:500:grp1:/home/user1:/bin/bash
```

With the `-f` option, the change information of the file will always be output unless the user exits the monitoring state with ++control+c++. This option is very frequently used to track log files (the logs) in real time.

Without the `-n` option, the `tail` command displays the last 10 lines of the file.

### `sort` command

The `sort` command sorts the lines of a file.

It allows you to order the result of a command or the content of a file in a given order, numerically, alphabetically, by size (KB, MB, GB) or in reverse order.

```bash
sort [-k] [-n] [-u] [-o file] [-t] file
```

Example:

```bash
$ sort -k 3,4 -t ":" -n /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm/:/sbin/nologin
```

| Option    | Description                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `-k`     | Specify the columns to be separated. You can specify multiple columns.         |
| `-n`      | Requests a numeric sort.                     |
| `-o file` | Saves the sort to the specified file.        |
| `-t`     | Specify a delimiter, which requires that the contents of the corresponding file must be regularly delimited column contents, otherwise they cannot be sorted properly. |
| `-r`      | Reverse the order of the result. Used in conjunction with the `-n` option to sort in order from largest to smallest.             |
| `-u`     | Remove duplicates after sorting. Equivalent to `sort file uniq`.                   |

The `sort` command sorts the file only on the screen. The file is not modified by the sorting. To save the sort, use the `-o` option or an output redirection `>`.

By default, the numbers are sorted according to their character. Thus, "110" will be before "20", which will itself be before "3". The `-n` option must be specified so that the numeric character blocks are sorted by their value.

The `sort` command reverses the order of the results, with the `-r` option:

```bash
$ sort -k 3 -t ":" -n -r /etc/passwd
nobody:x:65534:65534:Kernel Overflow User:/:/sbin/nologin
systemd-coredump:x:999:997:systemd Core Dumper:/:/sbin/nologin
polkitd:x:998:996:User for polkitd:/:/sbin/nologin
```

In this example, the `sort` command will sort the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file this time from largest uid (user identifier) to smallest.

Some advanced examples of using the `sort` command:

* Shuffling values

The `sort` command also allows you to shuffle values with the `-R` option:

```bash
sort -R /etc/passwd
```

* Sorting IP addresses

A system administrator is quickly confronted with the processing of IP addresses from the logs of his services such as SMTP, VSFTP or Apache. These addresses are typically extracted with the `cut` command.

Here is an example with the file `dns-client.txt`:

```text
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.200
5.1.150.146
208.128.150.98
208.128.150.99
```

```bash
$ sort -nr dns-client.txt
208.128.150.99
208.128.150.98
192.168.1.200
192.168.1.10
5.1.150.146
```

* Sorting file by removing duplicates

The `sort` command knows how to remove the duplicates from the file output using `-u` as option.

Here is an example with the file `colours.txt`:

```text
Red
Green
Blue
Red
Pink
```

```text
$ sort -u colours.txt
Blue
Green
Pink
Red
```

* Sorting file by sizes

The `sort` command knows how to recognize file sizes, from commands like `ls` with the `-h` option.

Here is an example with the file `size.txt`:

```text
1.7G
18M
69K
2.4M
1.2M
4.2G
6M
124M
12.4M
4G
```

```bash
$ sort -hr size.txt
4.2G
4G
1.7G
124M
18M
12.4M
6M
2.4M
1.2M
69K
```

### `wc` command

The `wc` command counts the number of lines, words and/or bytes in a file.

```bash
wc [-l] [-m] [-w] file [files]
```

| Option | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `-c`   | Count the number of bytes.      |
| `-m`   | Count the number of characters. |
| `-l`   | Counts the number of lines.     |
| `-w`   | Counts the number of words.     |

## Search

### `find` command

The `find` command searches for files or directories location.

```bash
find directory [-name name] [-type type] [-user login] [-date date]
```

Since there are so many options to the `find` command, it is best to refer to the `man`.

If the search directory is not specified, the `find` command will search from the current directory.

| Option              | Description                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `-perm permissions` | Search for files by their permissions. |
| `-size size`        | Search for files by size.              |

### `-exec` option of the `find` command

It is possible to use the `-exec` option of the `find` command to execute a command on each result line:

```bash
find /tmp -name *.txt -exec rm -f {} \;
```

The previous command searches for all files in the `/tmp` directory named `*.txt` and deletes them.

!!! Tip "Understand the `-exec` option"

    In the example above, the `find` command will construct a string representing the command to be executed.

    If the `find` command finds three files named `log1.txt`, `log2.txt`, and `log3.txt`, then the `find` command will construct the string by replacing in the string `rm -f {} \;` the braces with one of the results of the search, and do this as many times as there are results.

    This will give us:

    ```
    rm -f /tmp/log1.txt ; rm -f /tmp/log2.txt ; rm -f /tmp/log3.txt ;
    ```

    The `;` character is a special shell character that must be protected by a `\` to prevent it from being interpreted too early by the `find` command (and not in the `-exec`).

!!! Tip

    `$ find /tmp -name *.txt -delete` does the same thing.

### `whereis` command

The `whereis` command searches for files related to a command.

```bash
whereis [-b] [-m] [-s] command
```

Example:

```bash
$ whereis -b ls
ls: /bin/ls
```

| Option | Description                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `-b`   | Searches only the binary file.    |
| `-m`   | Searches only for man pages.    |
| `-s`   | Searches only for source files. |

### `grep` command

The `grep` command searches for a string in a file.

```bash
grep [-w] [-i] [-v] "string" file
```

Example:

```bash
$ grep -w "root:" /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

| Option                                                                                  | Description                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `-i`                                                                                    | Ignores the case of the searched string. |
| `-v`                                                                                    | Excludes lines containing the string.   |
| `-w`                                                                                    | Searches for the exact word.              |

The `grep` command returns the complete line containing the string you are looking for.

* The `^` special character is used to search for a string at the beginning of a line.
* The special character `$` searches for a string at the end of a line.

    ```bash
    grep -w "^root" /etc/passwd
    ```

!!! Note

    This command is very powerful and it is highly recommended to consult its manual. It has many derivatives.

It is possible to search for a string in a file tree with the `-R` option.

```bash
grep -R "Virtual" /etc/httpd
```

### Meta-characters (wildcards)

Meta-characters replace one or more characters (or even an absence of characters) during a search. These meta-characters are also known as wildcards.

They can be combined.

The `*` character replaces a string composed of any characters. The `*` character can also represent an absence of character.

```bash
$ find /home -name "test*"
/home/rockstar/test
/home/rockstar/test1
/home/rockstar/test11
/home/rockstar/tests
/home/rockstar/test362
```

Meta-characters allow more complex searches by replacing all or part of a word. Simply replace the unknowns with these special characters.

The character `?` replaces a single character, whatever it is.

```bash
$ find /home -name "test?"
/home/rockstar/test1
/home/rockstar/tests
```

The square brackets `[` and `]` are used to specify the values that a single character can take.

```bash
$ find /home -name "test[123]*"
/home/rockstar/test1
/home/rockstar/test11
/home/rockstar/test362
```

!!! Note

    Always surround words containing meta-characters with `"` to prevent them from being replaced by the names of files that meet the criteria.

!!! Warning

    Do not confuse shell meta-characters with regular expression meta-characters. The `grep` command uses regular expression meta-characters.

## Redirects and pipes

### Standard input and output

On UNIX and Linux systems, there are three standard streams. They allow programs, via the `stdio.h` library, to input or output information.

These streams are called X channel or X file descriptor.

By default:

* the keyboard is the input device for channel 0, called **stdin** ;
* the screen is the output device for channels 1 and 2, called **stdout** and **stderr**.

![standards channels](images/input-output.png)

**stderr** receives the error streams returned by a command. The other streams are directed to **stdout**.

These streams point to peripheral files, but since everything is a file in UNIX/Linux, I/O streams can easily be diverted to other files. This principle is the strength of the shell.

### Input redirection

It is possible to redirect the input stream from another file with the character `<` or `<<`. The command will read the file instead of the keyboard:

```bash
ftp -in serverftp << ftp-commands.txt
```

!!! Note

    Only commands that require keyboard input will be able to handle input redirection.

Input redirection can also be used to simulate user interactivity. The command will read the input stream until it encounters the defined keyword after the input redirection.

This feature is used to script interactive commands:

```bash
$ ftp -in serverftp << END
user alice password
put file
bye
END
```

The keyword `END` can be replaced by any word.

```bash
$ ftp -in serverftp << STOP
user alice password
put file
bye
STOP
```

The shell exits the `ftp` command when it receives a line containing only the keyword.

!!! Warning

    The ending keyword, here `END` or `STOP`, must be the only word on the line and must be at the beginning of the line.

The standard input redirection is rarely used because most commands accept a filename as an argument.

The command `wc` could be used like this:

```bash
$ wc -l .bash_profile
27 .bash_profile # the number of lines is followed by the file name
$ wc -l < .bash_profile
27 # returns only the number of lines
```

### Output redirection

Standard output can be redirected to other files using the `>` or `>>` characters.

The simple `>` redirection overwrites the contents of the output file:

```bash
date +%F > date_file
```

When the `>>` character is used, it indicates that the output result of the command is appended to the file content.

```bash
date +%F >> date_file
```

In both cases, the file is automatically created when it does not exist.

The standard error output can also be redirected to another file. This time it will be necessary to specify the channel number (which can be omitted for channels 0 and 1):

```bash
ls -R / 2> errors_file

ls -R / 2>> errors_file
```

### Examples of redirection

Redirection of 2 outputs to 2 files:

```bash
ls -R / >> ok_file 2>> nok_file
```

Redirection of the 2 outputs to a single file:

```bash
ls -R / >> log_file 2>&1
```

Redirection of _stderr_ to a "bottomless pit" (`/dev/null`):

```bash
ls -R / 2>> /dev/null
```

When both output streams are redirected, no information is displayed on the screen. To use both the output redirection and to keep the display, you will have to use the command `tee`.

### Pipes

A **pipe** is a mechanism allowing you to link the standard output of a first command to the standard input of a second command.

This communication is uni directional and is done with the `|` symbol. The pipe symbol `|` is obtained by pressing the  ++shift+bar++ simultaneously.

![pipe](images/pipe.png)

All data sent by the control on the left of the pipe through the standard output channel is sent to the standard input channel of the control on the right.

The commands particularly used after a pipe are filters.

* Examples:

Display only the beginning:

```bash
ls -lia / | head
```

Display only the end:

```bash
ls -lia / | tail
```

Sort the result:

```bash
ls -lia / | sort
```

Count the number of words / characters:

```bash
ls -lia / | wc
```

Search for a string in the result:

```bash
ls -lia / | grep fichier
```

## Special Points

### `tee` command

The `tee` command is used to redirect the standard output of a command to a file while maintaining the screen display.

It is combined with the `|` pipe to receive as input the output of the command to be redirected:

```bash
ls -lia / | tee fic

cat fic
```

The `-a` option adds to the file instead of overwriting it.

### `alias` and `unalias` commands

Using **alias** is a way to ask the shell to remember a particular command with its options and give it a name.

For example:

```bash
ll
```

will replace the command:

```bash
ls -l
```

The `alias` command lists the aliases for the current session. Aliases are set by default on Linux distributions. Here, the aliases for a Rocky server:

```bash
$ alias
alias l.='ls -d .* --color=auto'
alias ll='ls -l --color=auto'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
alias vi='vim'
alias which='alias | /usr/bin/which --tty-only --read-alias --show-dot --show-tilde'
```

The aliases are only defined temporarily, for the time of the user session.

For permanent use, they must be created in the:

* `.bashrc` file in the user's login directory;
* `/etc/bashrc` file for all users.

!!! Warning

    Special care must be taken when using aliases which can be potentially dangerous! For example, an alias set up without the administrator's knowledge:

    ```bash
    alias cd='rm -Rf'
    ```

The `unalias` command allows you to delete aliases.

To delete a single alias:

```bash
unalias ll
```

To delete all aliases:

```bash
unalias -a
```

To disable an alias temporarily, the combination is `\<alias name>`.

For example if we do:

```bash
type ls
```

it might return the following:

```bash
ls is an alias to « ls -rt »
```

Now that this is known, we can see the results of using the alias or disabling it one time with the `\` by executing the following:

```bash
$ ls file*   # order by time
file3.txt  file2.txt  file1.txt
$ \ls file*  # order by name
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt
```

### Aliases and Useful Functions

* `grep` alias.

Colorize the result of the `grep` command: `alias grep='grep --color=auto'`

* `mcd` function

It is common to create a folder and then move around in it: `mcd() { mkdir -p "$1"; cd "$1"; }`

* `cls` function

Move to a folder and list its contents: `cls() { cd "$1"; ls; }`

* `backup` function

Create a backup copy of a file: `backup() { cp "$1"{,.bak}; }`

* `extract` function

Extract any type of archive:

```bash
extract () {
  if [ -f $1 ] ; then
    case $1 in
      *.tar.bz2) tar xjf $1 ;;
      *.tar.gz) tar xzf $1 ;;
      *.bz2) bunzip2 $1 ;;
      *.rar) unrar e $1 ;;
      *.gz) gunzip $1 ;;
      *.tar) tar xf $1 ;;
      *.tbz2) tar xjf $1 ;;
      *.tgz) tar xzf $1 ;;
      *.zip) unzip $1 ;;
      *.Z) uncompress $1 ;;
      *.7z) 7z x $1 ;;
      *)
        echo "'$1' cannot be extracted via extract()" ;;
    esac
  else
    echo "'$1' is not a valid file"
  fi
}

```

* If `alias cmount` returns the following: `alias cmount="mount | column -t"`

Then we can use `cmount` to show all of the system mounts in columns like this: `[root]# cmount`

which would return our mounted filesystem in the following format:

```bash
/dev/simfs  on  /                                          type  simfs        (rw,relatime,usrquota,grpquota)
proc        on  /proc                                      type  proc         (rw,relatime)
sysfs       on  /sys                                       type  sysfs        (rw,relatime)
none        on  /dev                                       type  devtmpfs     (rw,relatime,mode=755)
none        on  /dev/pts                                   type  devpts       (rw,relatime,mode=600,ptmxmode=000)
none        on  /dev/shm                                   type  tmpfs        (rw,relatime)
none        on  /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc                   type  binfmt_misc  (rw,relatime)
```

### The character `;`

The `;` character strings the commands.

The commands will all run sequentially in the order of input once the user presses ++enter++.

```bash
ls /; cd /home; ls -lia; cd /
```
