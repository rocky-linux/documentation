# Overview

The GNU/Linux operating system follows the philosophy of "everything is a file". A side consequence of this philosophy is that system administrators often have to interact with files, file names, and file contents.

Regarding processing file content, the three tools `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` are potent and frequently used, so people call them the "Three Swordsmen".
