# :simple-neovim: Turning Neovim into an advanced IDE

## :material-arrow-bottom-right-bold-outline: Pre-requisites

As specified on the NvChad site you need to ensure the system meets the following requirements:

* [Neovim 0.10.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.10.0).
* [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) Set it in your terminal emulator.
    * Make sure the nerd font you set doesn't end with **Mono**
    * **Example:** Iosevka Nerd Font and not ~~Iosevka Nerd Font Mono~~
* [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is required for grep searching with Telescope **(OPTIONAL)**.
* GCC and Make

??? warning "Performing a Clean Installation"

    As specified in the requirements, installing this new configuration on top of a previous one can create unfixable problems. A clean installation is recommended.

### :material-content-save-cog-outline: Preliminary Operations

If you have used the Neovim installation before, it will have created three folders in which to write your files, which are:

```text
~/.config/nvim
~/.local/share/nvim
~/.cache/nvim
```

To perform a clean installation of the configuration, we need to back up the previous one first:

```bash
mkdir ~/backup_nvim
cp -r ~/.config/nvim ~/backup_nvim
cp -r ~/.local/share/nvim ~/backup_nvim
cp -r ~/.cache/nvim ~/backup_nvim
```

And then we delete all previous configurations and files:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim
```

## :material-monitor-arrow-down-variant: Installation

The creation of the configuration structure is implemented by copying files from an initialization repository (==starter==) using *Git*. This method allows installing the NvChad configuration, prepared as a Neovim plugin, within the *lazy.nvim* plugin manager.  
This way, the configuration is updated like all other plugins, simplifying the user's management. Moreover, this approach makes the entire user configuration independent, allowing its total management and distribution among multiple machines.

To download and initialize the configuration, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/starter ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```

The command consists of two parts. The first downloads the contents of the *starter* repository to `~/.config/nvim/` (default folder for Neovim settings), while the second invokes the ==nvim== executable which initializes the editor with the configuration you just downloaded. Once you have finished installing the plugins and parsers, you will be faced with the following screen. To close the plugins manager, type ++"q "++ :

![NvChad Install](images/install_nvchad_25.png)

The initial configuration is minimal and provides a starting point for your customization. As evidenced by the screenshot when the editor is first started, only four modules (==plugins==), marked with a checkmark, are loaded, which are as follows:

* **base46** - provides editor themes
* **NvChad** - the basic configuration that allows the user configuration to be entered into Neovim
* **nvim-treesitter** - for analysis and highlighting of code
* **ui** - the editor interface (statusline, tabufline..)

The remaining modules will be activated, thanks to the ==*lazyloading*== technique, when the functionality provided by the module is requested. This improves the performance of the editor in general and, in particular, improves its startup time.

At this point, the editor is ready to be used. The following sections provide an in-depth look at the installation process and are not necessary for its day-to-day use. If you are interested only in its use, you can turn to the [Using NvChad](./nvchad_ui/using_nvchad.md) page.  
However, reading the [official documentation](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install) for an introduction to its components and functionality remains recommended.

To close the editor, use the key ++colon++ ++"q "++.

### :material-timer-cog-outline: Bootstrap

The bootstrap process is implemented in the ==*init.lua*== file of the *starter* repository and consists of the following steps:

An initial setting of the default theme path and `<leader>` key, in this case the ++space++ key:

```lua
vim.g.base46_cache = vim.fn.stdpath "data" .. "/nvchad/base46/"
vim.g.mapleader = " "
```

A subsequent installation of the main **lazy.nvim** plugin:

```lua
-- bootstrap lazy and all plugins
local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath "data" .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim"

if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
  local repo = "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git"
  vim.fn.system { "git", "clone", "--filter=blob:none", repo, "--branch=stable", lazypath }
end

vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)

local lazy_config = require "configs.lazy"
```

And installation of NvChad plugins and all those configured in the `plugins` folder:

```lua
-- load plugins
require("lazy").setup({
  {
    "NvChad/NvChad",
    lazy = false,
    branch = "v2.5",
    import = "nvchad.plugins",
    config = function()
      require "options"
    end,
  },

  { import = "plugins" },
}, lazy_config)
```

Then apply the theme to the *default* and *statusline* settings:

```lua
-- load theme
dofile(vim.g.base46_cache .. "defaults")
dofile(vim.g.base46_cache .. "statusline")
```

When finished, the ==autocmds== ([Neovim auto-commands](https://neovim.io/doc/user/autocmd.html)) required for configuration operation and keyboard mappings are also entered:

```lua
require "nvchad.autocmds"

vim.schedule(function()
  require "mappings"
end)
```

## :material-file-tree-outline: Configuration Structure

The structure installed by NvChad is as follows:

```text
~/.config/nvim/
├── init.lua
├── lazy-lock.json
├── LICENSE
├── lua
│   ├── chadrc.lua
│   ├── configs
│   │   ├── conform.lua
│   │   └── lazy.lua
│   ├── mappings.lua
│   ├── options.lua
│   └── plugins
│       └── init.lua
└── README.md
```

It consists of a starting file **init.lua** that initializes and coordinates the insertion of customizations into the configuration of ==Neovim==, this file initially looks identical to the file used by the *bootstrap* from the **starter** repository shown above, it will be used later for loading other files into the configuration such as its own *autocommands.lua* file.

This is followed by the **lazy-lock.json** file where all the plugins in the installation and their status with respect to development on *GitHub* are stored. This file allows the editor status to be synchronized between installations present on multiple machines and allows custom installations to replicate the desired status.

The rest of the configuration is located in the `lua` folder and is initialized starting with the **chadrc.lua** file, which in the initial version contains only the editor theme setting.  
This file is used for customizing the appearance of the editor (==UI==) and shares syntax with the [nvconfig.lua](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/blob/v2.5/lua/nvconfig.lua) file of the **NvChad** plugin; to compile it, simply copy the desired part of the *nvconfig.lua* file into your *chadrc.lua* and change its properties as needed.

The next file used by the configuration, the folders will be described later, is the **option.lua** file for editor customizations, such as indentation spaces, sharing the clipboard with the guest system, and very importantly, the inclusion of the binaries installed by *Mason* in the path.  
Like the previous one, it shares the syntax of the [corresponding file](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/blob/v2.5/lua/nvchad/options.lua) of the **NvChad** plugin; for its customization as above, simply copy the options and edit them.

Last, the **mapping.lua** file is encountered where to set the keyboard keys to invoke the various features offered by the editor. The initial file contains the key mapping for entering **COMMAND** mode, for formatting with *conform.nvim* and the key for exiting **INSERT** mode.  
The keys use Neovim's native `vim.keymap.set` syntax and for their configuration you can refer to NvChad's [default mapping](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/blob/v2.5/lua/nvchad/mappings.lua) or alternatively to the help page included in Neovim `:h vim.keymap.set`.

```lua
require "nvchad.mappings"

-- add yours here

local map = vim.keymap.set

map("n", ";", ":", { desc = "CMD enter command mode" })

map("n", "<leader>fm", function()
  require("conform").format()
end, { desc = "File Format with conform" })

map("i", "jk", "<ESC>", { desc = "Escape insert mode" })
```

The two folders included in the configuration `configs` and `plugins` both serve to manage plugins; personal plugins should be placed in the `plugins` folder and their additional configurations, if any, in the `configs` folder.  
Initially, a *plugins/init.lua* file will be available for installation with the *conform.lua* plugin configured in *configs/conform.lua* and *nvimtree.nvim* with the option for decorations related to *Git* inside it.

!!! notes "Organization of plugins"

    The inclusion of plugins is done by inserting any properly configured file present in the `plugins` folder, this allows the plugins to be organized, for example by purpose, by creating separate files (*utils.lua*, *editor.lua*, *markdown.lua*, etc.) in this way it is possible to work on the configuration in a more orderly manner.

There are also files for *licensing* and a *README.md* copied from the **starter** repository that can be used to illustrate one's configuration in case it is maintained in a *Git* repository.

## :material-keyboard-outline: Main keyboard keys

This is the call that returns basic command mappings:

```lua
vim.schedule(function()
  require "mappings"
end)
```

This sets four main keys from which, in association with other keys, commands can be launched. The main keys are:

* C = ++ctrl++
* leader = ++space++
* A = ++alt++
* S = ++shift++

!!! note

    We will refer to these key mappings several times throughout these documents. 

The default mapping is contained in *lua/mapping.lua* of the NvChad plugin but can be extended with other custom commands using its own *mappings.lua*.

`<leader>th` to change the theme ++space++ + ++"t"++ + ++"h"++  
`<C-n>` to open nvimtree ++ctrl++ + ++"n"++  
`<A-i>` to open a terminal in a floating tab ++alt++ + ++"i"++

There are many combinations pre-set for you, and they cover all the uses of NvChad. It is worth pausing to analyze the key mappings before starting to use your NvChad-configured instance of Neovim.
