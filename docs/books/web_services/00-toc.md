Rocky Linux is part of the Enterprise Linux family, making it particularly well suited to hosting web services such as file servers (FTP, sFTP), web servers (apache, nginx), application servers (PHP, Python), database servers (MariaDB, Mysql, PostgreSQL) or more specific services such as load balancing, caching, proxy or reverse proxy (HAProxy, Varnish, Squid).

The web would not exist without email. Web services generally make extensive use of mail servers (Postfix).

Sometimes, these services are extremely busy or require highly available services. Other services can be implemented in these cases to guarantee optimal service performance (Heartbeat, PCS).

Each chapter of this book can be consulted independently, according to your needs, and reading the chapters in order is not compulsory.

This book is also part of a series of books dedicated to system administration under Linux (Admin Guide, Learning Bash, Learning Ansible). Where necessary, you will be invited to review the concepts you may be missing in the corresponding chapters of the books mentioned above.

## Public

The target audience for this book is system administrators already trained in the use of system administration commands (see [our book Admin Guide](../admin_guide/00-toc.md)) who want to install, configure, and secure their web services.

## How to use this book

This book has been designed as a training manual, and you can use it in several ways. It can be used as a training aid for trainers or as a self-training aid for administrators wishing to acquire new skills or reinforce their existing knowledge.

To implement some of the services presented in this book, you may need two (or more) servers to put the theory into practice.
