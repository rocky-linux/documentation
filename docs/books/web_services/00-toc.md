Rocky Linux is part of the Enterprise Linux family, making it particularly well suited to hosting web services such as file servers (FTP, sFTP), web servers (apache, nginx), application servers (PHP, Python), database servers (MariaDB, Mysql, PostgreSQL) or more specific services such as load balancing, caching, proxy or reverse proxy (HAProxy, Varnish, Squid).

The web would not be what it is without email. Web services generally make extensive use of mail servers (Postfix).

Sometimes these services are extremely busy or require highly available services. In these cases, other services can be implemented to guarantee optimal service performance (Heartbeat, PCS).

Each chapter of this book can be consulted independently, according to your needs, and it is not compulsory to read the chapters in order.

This book is also part of a series of books dedicated to system administration under Linux (Admin Guide, Learning Bash, Learning Ansible). Where necessary, you will be invited to review the concepts you may be missing in the corresponding chapters of the above-mentioned books.

## Public

The target audience for this book is system administrators already trained in the use of system administration commands (see [our book Admin Guide](../admin_guide/00-toc.md)), who want to install, configure and secure their web services.

## How to use this book

This book has been designed as a training manual, so that it can be used in several ways. Either as a training aid for trainers, or as a self-training aid for administrators wishing to acquire new skills or reinforce their existing knowledge.

To implement some of the services presented in this book, you may need two (or more) servers to put the theory into practice.
