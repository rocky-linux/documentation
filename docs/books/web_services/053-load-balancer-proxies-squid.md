### Generalities

Setting up a proxy server involves choosing between two types of architecture:

* A standard proxy architecture requiring specific configuration of each client and their web browsers
* Captive proxy architecture, which involves intercepting the frames sent by the client and rewriting them to the proxy server

In either case, a break in the network occurs: A client can no longer physically address a remote server directly without going through a proxy server.

Two firewalls protect the client workstation but never communicate directly with the outside network.

![Proxy-based architecture](img/squid-architecture-proxy.png)

!!! Note 

    This architecture requires browser configuration on the client workstation.

You don't need to configure all client workstations with a captive proxy.

The configuration occurs at the gateway level, where it receives client requests and transparently rewrites the frames to send them to the proxy.

![Captive proxy-based architecture](img/squid-architecture-proxy-captif.png)

!!! Note 

    This architecture requires a specific configuration on the router.

In the case of standard proxy or captive proxy architecture, one of the primary interests of this type of service is to act as a cache.

In this way, a file downloaded once from the WAN (potentially from a slower link than the LAN) stores itself in memory in the proxy cache for subsequent clients to use. This optimizes bandwidth on the slow link.

As you will see later, there are other uses for a proxy.

Deploying a proxy can:

* Deny access to specific resources based on various parameters
* Set up authentication and monitoring of clients' Internet activities
* Set up a hierarchy of distributed caches
* Hide the LAN architecture from a WAN point of view (how many clients are there on the LAN?)

Among the advantages are the following:

* Anonymity on the Internet
* Authentication
* Client activity logging
* Filtering
* Limiting access
* Bandwidth optimization
* Security

!!! Note

    Implementing authentication blocks many of the malicious effects of viruses on the LAN.

!!! Warning

    The proxy service becomes a critical service requiring high availability.

When operating a Squid Proxy server, the administrator must exploit the logs. Therefore, it is essential to know the main HTTP response codes.

| Code | Categories             |
|------|------------------------|
| 1XX  | Info                   |
| 2XX  | Success                |
| 3XX  | Redirection            |
| 4XX  | Customer request error |
| 5XX  | Server error           |

Examples:

* 200: ok
* 301: Moved Permanently
* 302: Moved Temporarily
* 304: Not modified
* 400: Bad request
* 401: Unauthorized
* 404: Not found

#### About Squid

Squid supports HTTP and FTP protocols.

The advantages of installing a solution based on the Squid server:

* Hardware solutions are expensive
* Developed since 1996
* Released under GNU/GPL license

##### Sizing

* Ensure high availability
* Use fast hard disks for caching
* RAM and CPU should be correctly sized

!!! Note

    Allow 14MB of RAM per GB of disk cache.

### Installation

Install the `squid` package:

```bash
sudo dnf install squid
```

!!! Warning

    Take care not to start the service until the cache has been initialized!

#### Squid server tree and files

The single configuration file is `/etc/squid/squid.conf`.

Service logs (stop and restart) are in `/var/log/squid.cache.log`, while client requests are in `/var/log/squid/access.log`. By default, cache files are in `/var/spool/squid/`.

#### The `squid` command

The `squid` command controls the squid server.

Syntax of the command:

```bash
squid [-z|-s|-k parse|-k rotate]
```

| Option      | Description                  |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| `-z`        | Initializes cache directories |
| `-s`        | Enables syslog logging       |
| `-k parse`  | Test configuration file      |
| `-k rotate` | Rotates logs                 |

Logging client requests can quickly lead to storing large amounts of data.

It is a good idea to regularly create a new log file and archive the old one in compressed format.

You can do this either manually, with the `-k rotate` option of the `squid` command, or automatically with the dedicated Linux service `logrotate`.

### Configuration

Configure Squid in `/etc/squid/squid.conf`.

* Proxy port number (listening port) `http_port`

```bash
http_port num_port
```

!!! Note

    The port number is set to 3128 by default but frequently changes to 8080. Remember to open the corresponding firewall port!

When the service restarts, the Squid server will listen on the port defined by the `http_port` directive.

* RAM reservation `cache_mem`

```bash
cache_mem taille KB|taille MB|taille GB
```

For example:

```bash
cache_mem 1 GB
```

!!! Tip

    Best practice: 1/3 of total RAM allocated

* Internet Cache Protocol (ICP) `icp_port`

The Internet Cache Protocol (ICP) enables neighboring Squid servers to exchange requests. It is common practice to propose a hierarchy of proxies that share their information bases.

The `icp_port` directive defines the port number Squid uses to send and receive ICP requests from neighboring Squid servers.

!!! Tip

    Set to 0 to deactivate.

* Anonymous FTP user `ftp_user`

The `ftp_user` directive associates an FTP user with anonymous FTP connections. The user must have a valid e-mail address.

```bash
ftp_user bob@rockylinux.lan
```

* Set up Access Control Lists

ACL syntax:

```bash
acl name type argument
http_access allow|deny aclname
```

Example:

```bash
acl LUNCHTIME time 12:00-14:00
http_access deny LUNCHTIME
```

A more extensive discussion of ACLs is in the "Advanced configuration" section.

* Maximum size of a cached object `maximum_object_size`

`maximum_object_size` directive syntax:

```bash
maximum_object_size size
```

Example:

```bash
maximum_object_size 32 MB
```

The object is not cached if the object size is greater than the `maximum_object_size` limit.

* Proxy server name `visible_hostname`

Syntax of `visible_hostname` directive:

```bash
visible_hostname name
```

Example:

```bash
visible_hostname proxysquid
```

!!! Note

    The value supplied may be different from the hostname.

* Define a cache for squid `cache_ufs`

```bash
cache_ufs format path size nbFolderNiv1 nbFolderNiv2
```

IDefining multiple caches on different file systems to optimize access times is possible.

Example:

```bash
cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid/ 100 16 256
```

| Option | Description              |
|--------|--------------------------|
| ufs    | Unix File System         |
| 100    | Size in mega             |
| 16     | 16 top-level folders     |
| 256    | 256 second-level folders |

When the service launches for the first time, it generates the cache directory:

```bash
sudo squid -z
sudo systemctl start squid
```

### Advanced configuration

#### Les Access Control List (ACL)

Syntax of the `http_access` directive

```bash
http_access allow|deny [!]acl_name
```

Example:

```bash
http_access allow LUNCHTIME
http_access deny !LUNCHTIME
```

The `!acl_name` ACL is the opposite of the `acl_name` ACL.

Syntax of the `acl` directive:

```bash
acl name type argument
```

The order of ACLs is cumulative. Several ACLs with the same name represent a single ACL.

Examples:

Lunchtime authorization:

```bash
acl LUNCHTIME time 12:00-14:00
http_access allow LUNCHTIME
```

Ban videos:

```bash
acl VIDEOS rep_mime_type video/mpeg
acl VIDEOS rep_mime_type video/avi
http_access deny VIDEOS
```

Managing IP addresses:

```bash
acl XXX src 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
acl XXX dst 10.10.10.1
```

FQDN management:

```bash
acl XXX srcdomain .rockylinux.org
acl XXX dstdomain .linux.org
```

Port management:

```bash
acl XXX port 80 21
```

Protocol management:

```bash
acl XXX proto HTTP FTP
```

#### Caching algorithms

Different cache algorithms exist with different characteristics:

* LRU - *Least Recently Used*: removes the oldest objects from the RAM
* LRU-THOLD: copies an object to the cache according to its size
* MRU: *Most Recently Used*: deletes the least requested data
* GDSF: *Greedy Dual Size Frequency*: deletes according to original size and access time with the smallest retained
* LFUDA: *Least Frequently Used With Dynamic Aging*: same as GDSF, but without the notion of size. Useful for caches with large files

#### Client authentication

Squid relies on external programs to manage authentication. It can be based on a simple flat file such as `htpasswd` or on LDAP, SMB, PAM, or other services.

Authentication can also be a legal necessity. Remember to get your users to sign a usage charter!

### Tools

#### The `squidclient` command

Use the `squidclient` command to test a request to the squid server.

`squidclient` command syntax:

```bash
squidclient [-s] [-h target] [-p port] url
```

Example:

```bash
squidclient -s -h localhost -p 8080 http://localhost/
```

| Option | Description                                   |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `-s`   | Silent mode (displays nothing in the console) |
| `-h`   | Defines target proxy                          |
| `-p`   | Listening port (default 3128)                 |
| `-r`   | Forces the server to reload the object        |

#### Analyze logs

You can monitor Squid's log records with the command:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log
```

Decomposition of a log line:

| Option        | Description                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Date          | Log timestamp                         |
| Response time | Response time for request             |
| @client       | Client IP address                     |
| Status code   | HTTP response code                    |
| Size          | Transfer size                         |
| Method        | HTTP method (Put / Get / Post / etc.) |
| URL           | Request URL                           |
| Peer Code     | Inter-proxy response code             |
| File type     | Mime type of request target           |

### Security

The firewall should be open for the listening port:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=3128/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will install Squid on your server and use it to download updates.

#### Task 1: Install and configure Squid

Install Squid:

```bash
sudo dnf install squid
sudo systemctl enable squid
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=3128/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Remove the comment in this line of the `/etc/squid/squid.conf` file to create a cache directory on disk:

```bash
cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 100 16 512
```

Adjust the cache size as required.

Create the cache directories and start the service.

```bash
sudo squid -z
sudo systemctl start squid
```

#### Task 2: Use your proxy with curl

Open a new terminal on your proxy server to follow the proxy's access.

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log
```

On the second terminal, use `curl` to access a web page through the proxy:

```bash
$ curl -I --proxy "http://192.168.1.10:3128" https://docs.rockylinux.org  
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established

HTTP/2 200 
content-type: text/html
...
```

As you can see, two HTTP connections exist. The first is with the proxy, and the second is from the proxy to the remote server.

You can see the trace on your second terminal:

```bash
1723793294.548     77 192.168.1.10 TCP_TUNNEL/200 3725 CONNECT docs.rockylinux.org:443 - HIER_DIRECT/151.101.122.132 -
```

The content is not cached here as you request an `https` connection to the remote server.

#### Task 3: Configure DNS to use your proxy server

Edit the `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf` file to use the proxy squid:

```bash
[main]
gpgcheck=1
installonly_limit=3
clean_requirements_on_remove=True
best=True
skip_if_unavailable=False
proxy=http://192.168.1.10:3128
```

Clean your `dnf` cache and try an update:

```bash
sudo dnf clean all
sudo dnf update
```

Verify on your terminal that the `dnf` connection uses your proxy to download its update. Note that the "URL of repository" in the line that follows will be replaced with the actual mirror URL.:

```bash
1723793986.725     20 192.168.1.10 TCP_MISS/200 5238 GET "URL of repository"/9.4/extras/x86_64/os/repodata/7d78a729-8e9a-4066-96d4-ab8ed8f06ee8-FILELISTS.xml.gz - HIER_DIRECT/193.106.119.144 application/x-gzip
...
1723794176.255      1 192.168.1.10 TCP_HIT/200 655447 GET "URL of repository"/9.4/AppStream/x86_64/os/repodata/1af312c9-7139-43ed-8761-90ba3cd55461-UPDATEINFO.xml.gz - HIER_NONE/- application/x-gzip
```

In this example, you can see one connection with a TCP_MISS (not present in the cache) and another with TCP_HIT (use the cache to answer the client).

### Conclusion

You now have the knowledge you need to install Squid on your local network. This will enable you to centralize your outgoing connections to the Internet and secure your local network.
