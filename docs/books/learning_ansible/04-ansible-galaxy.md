[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com) provides Ansible Roles and Collections from the Ansible Community.

The elements provided can be referenced in the playbooks and used out of the box

## `ansible-galaxy` command

The `ansible-galaxy` command manages roles and collections using [galaxy.ansible.com](http://galaxy.ansible.com).

* To manage roles:

```bash
ansible-galaxy role [import|init|install|login|remove|...]
```

| Sub-commands | Functionality                                              |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `install`    | installs a role.                                          |
| `remove`     | remove one or more roles.                                 |
| `list`       | display the name and the version of installed roles.      |
| `info`       | display information about a role.                         |
| `init`       | generate a skeleton of a new role.                        |
| `import`     | import a role from the galaxy web site. Requires a login. |

* To manage collections:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection [import|init|install|login|remove|...]
```

| Sub-commands | Functionality                                               |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `init`       | generate a skeleton of a new collection.                   |
| `install`    | installs a collection.                                     |
| `list`       | display the name and the version of installed collections. |

## Ansible Roles

An Ansible role is a unit that promotes the reusability of playbooks.

!!! Note

    More information can be [found here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)

### Installing useful Roles

In order to highlight the interest of using roles, I suggest you to use the `alemorvan/patchmanagement` role, which will allow you to perform a lot of tasks (pre-update or post-update for example) during your update process, in only a few lines of code.

You can check the code in the github repo of the role [here](https://github.com/alemorvan/patchmanagement).

* Install the role. This needs only one command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy role install alemorvan.patchmanagement
```

* Create a playbook to include the role:

```bash
- name: Start a Patch Management
  hosts: ansible_clients
  vars:
    pm_before_update_tasks_file: custom_tasks/pm_before_update_tasks_file.yml
    pm_after_update_tasks_file: custom_tasks/pm_after_update_tasks_file.yml

  tasks:
    - name: "Include patchmanagement"
      include_role:
        name: "alemorvan.patchmanagement"
```

With this role, you can add your own tasks for all your inventory or for only your targeted node.

Let's create tasks that will be run before and after the update process:

* Create the `custom_tasks` folder:

```bash
mkdir custom_tasks
```

* Create the `custom_tasks/pm_before_update_tasks_file.yml` (feel free to change the name and the content of this file)

```bash
---
- name: sample task before the update process
  debug:
    msg: "This is a sample tasks, feel free to add your own test task"
```

* Create the `custom_tasks/pm_after_update_tasks_file.yml` (feel free to change the name and the content of this file)

```bash
---
- name: sample task after the update process
  debug:
    msg: "This is a sample tasks, feel free to add your own test task"
```

And launch your first Patch Management:

```bash
ansible-playbook patchmanagement.yml

```

Pretty easy for such a complex process, isn't it?

This is just one example of what can be done using roles made available by the community. Have a look at [galaxy.ansible.com](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) to discover the roles that could be useful for you!

You can also create your own roles for your own needs and publish them on the Internet if you feel like it. This is what we will briefly cover in the next chapter.

### Introduction to Role development

A role skeleton, serving as a starting point for custom role development, can be generated by the `ansible-galaxy` command:

```bash
$ ansible-galaxy role init rocky8
- Role rocky8 was created successfully
```

The command will generate the following tree structure to contain the `rocky8` role:

```bash
tree rocky8/
rocky8/
├── defaults
│   └── main.yml
├── files
├── handlers
│   └── main.yml
├── meta
│   └── main.yml
├── README.md
├── tasks
│   └── main.yml
├── templates
├── tests
│   ├── inventory
│   └── test.yml
└── vars
    └── main.yml

8 directories, 8 files
```

Roles allow you to do away with the need to include files. There is no need to specify file paths or `include` directives in playbooks. You just have to specify a task, and Ansible takes care of the inclusions.

The structure of a role is fairly obvious to understand.

Variables are simply stored either in `vars/main.yml` if the variables are not to be overridden, or in `default/main.yml` if you want to leave the possibility of overriding the variable content from outside your role.

The handlers, files, and templates needed for your code are stored in `handlers/main.yml`, `files` and `templates` respectively.

All that remains is to define the code for your role's tasks in `tasks/main.yml`.

Once all this is working well, you can use this role in your playbooks. You will be able to use your role without worrying about the technical aspect of its tasks, while customizing its operation with variables.

### Practical work: create a first simple role

Let's implement this with a "go anywhere" role that will create a default user and install software packages. This role can be systematically applied to all your servers.

#### Variables

We will create a `rockstar` user on all of our servers. As we don't want this user to be overridden, let's define it in the `vars/main.yml`:

```bash
---
rocky8_default_group:
  name: rockstar
  gid: 1100
rocky8_default_user:
  name: rockstar
  uid: 1100
  group: rockstar
```

We can now use those variables inside our `tasks/main.yml` without any inclusion.

```bash
---
- name: Create default group
  group:
    name: "{{ rocky8_default_group.name }}"
    gid: "{{ rocky8_default_group.gid }}"

- name: Create default user
  user:
    name: "{{ rocky8_default_user.name }}"
    uid: "{{ rocky8_default_user.uid }}"
    group: "{{ rocky8_default_user.group }}"
```

To test your new role, let's create a `test-role.yml` playbook in the same directory as your role:

```bash
---
- name: Test my role
  hosts: localhost

  roles:

    - role: rocky8
      become: true
      become_user: root
```

and launch it:

```bash
ansible-playbook test-role.yml

PLAY [Test my role] ************************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [rocky8 : Create default group] *******************************************************************
changed: [localhost]

TASK [rocky8 : Create default user] ********************************************************************
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=3    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   
```

Congratulations! You are now able to create great things with a playbook of only a few lines.

Let's see the use of default variables.

Create a list of packages to install by default on your servers and an empty list of packages to uninstall. Edit the `defaults/main.yml` files and add those two lists:

```bash
rocky8_default_packages:
  - tree
  - vim
rocky8_remove_packages: []
```

and use them in your `tasks/main.yml`:

```bash
- name: Install default packages (can be overridden)
  package:
    name: "{{ rocky8_default_packages }}"
    state: present

- name: "Uninstall default packages (can be overridden) {{ rocky8_remove_packages }}"
  package:
    name: "{{ rocky8_remove_packages }}"
    state: absent
```

Test your role with the help of the playbook previously created:

```bash
ansible-playbook test-role.yml

PLAY [Test my role] ************************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [rocky8 : Create default group] *******************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [rocky8 : Create default user] ********************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [rocky8 : Install default packages (can be overridden)] ********************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [rocky8 : Uninstall default packages (can be overridden) []] ***************************************
ok: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=5    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   
```

You can now override the `rocky8_remove_packages` in your playbook and uninstall for example `cockpit`:

```bash
---
- name: Test my role
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    rocky8_remove_packages:
      - cockpit

  roles:

    - role: rocky8
      become: true
      become_user: root
```

```bash
ansible-playbook test-role.yml

PLAY [Test my role] ************************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [rocky8 : Create default group] *******************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [rocky8 : Create default user] ********************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [rocky8 : Install default packages (can be overridden)] ********************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [rocky8 : Uninstall default packages (can be overridden) ['cockpit']] ******************************
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=5    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   
```

Obviously, there is no limit to how much you can improve your role. Imagine that for one of your servers, you need a package that is in the list of those to be uninstalled. You could then, for example, create a new list that can be overridden and then remove from the list of packages to be uninstalled those in the list of specific packages to be installed by using the jinja `difference()` filter.

```bash
- name: "Uninstall default packages (can be overridden) {{ rocky8_remove_packages }}"
  package:
    name: "{{ rocky8_remove_packages | difference(rocky8_specifics_packages) }}"
    state: absent
```

## Ansible Collections

Collections are a distribution format for Ansible content that can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins.

!!! Note

    More information can be [found here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html)

To install or upgrade a collection:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install namespace.collection [--upgrade]
```

You can then use the newly installed collection using its namespace and name before the module's name or role's name:

```bash
- import_role:
    name: namespace.collection.rolename

- namespace.collection.modulename:
    option1: value
```

You can find a collection index [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index.html).

Let's install the `community.general` collection:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
Starting galaxy collection install process
Process install dependency map
Starting collection install process
Downloading https://galaxy.ansible.com/download/community-general-3.3.2.tar.gz to /home/ansible/.ansible/tmp/ansible-local-51384hsuhf3t5/tmpr_c9qrt1/community-general-3.3.2-f4q9u4dg
Installing 'community.general:3.3.2' to '/home/ansible/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/community/general'
community.general:3.3.2 was installed successfully
```

We can now use the newly available module `yum_versionlock`:

```bash
- name: Start a Patch Management
  hosts: ansible_clients
  become: true
  become_user: root
  tasks:

    - name: Ensure yum-versionlock is installed
      package:
        name: python3-dnf-plugin-versionlock
        state: present

    - name: Prevent kernel from being updated
      community.general.yum_versionlock:
        state: present
        name: kernel
      register: locks

    - name: Display locks
      debug:
        var: locks.meta.packages                            
```

```bash
ansible-playbook versionlock.yml

PLAY [Start a Patch Management] *************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] **********************************************************************************
ok: [192.168.1.11]

TASK [Ensure yum-versionlock is installed] **************************************************************
changed: [192.168.1.11]

TASK [Prevent kernel from being updated] ****************************************************************
changed: [192.168.1.11]

TASK [Display locks] ************************************************************************************
ok: [192.168.1.11] => {
    "locks.meta.packages": [
        "kernel"
    ]
}

PLAY RECAP **********************************************************************************************
192.168.1.11               : ok=4    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   

```

### Creating your own collection

As with roles, you are able to create your own collection with the help of the `ansible-galaxy` command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection init rocky8.rockstarcollection
- Collection rocky8.rockstarcollection was created successfully
```

```bash
tree rocky8/rockstarcollection/
rocky8/rockstarcollection/
├── docs
├── galaxy.yml
├── plugins
│   └── README.md
├── README.md
└── roles
```

You can then store your own plugins or roles inside this new collection.
