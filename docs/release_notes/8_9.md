# Release notes for Rocky Linux 8.9

You can find a complete list of most changes in the [upstream release notes found here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.9_release_notes/index)

## Upgrading

You can upgrade from Rocky Linux 8.x to Rocky Linux 8.9 by running `sudo dnf -y upgrade`.

## Images

Several images are available along with the normal install images, including cloud and container platforms.

You can find more on the artifacts produced by the Cloud Special Interest Group, and information for how to get involved on the [SIG/Cloud Wiki page](https://sig-cloud.rocky.page/).

## Installing

To install Rocky Linux 8.9, head to the [download page](https://rockylinux.org/download/) and download the version you need for your architecture.

## The Rocky team release highlights

### Breaking changes

* The optional `guest-agents` group, previously available within both the *Minimal Install* and *Custom Operating System* base environments in anaconda, is no longer available for selection as additional software for those environments. If you require the `guest-agents` group, it is available in either the *Server* or *Server with GUI* base environments. If you install *Minimal Install* or *Custom Operating System* and still want guest-agents, you can do so by installing the package target directly in Kickstart, or by installing it with DNF after installation has completed (i.e., dnf install @guest-agents).

#### Live Images

* The KDE live image for Rocky Linux 8.9 had problems during the testing phase. For this, we will be providing the older 8.8 images until we can build and provide a working image.
