### Context

Some modules and packages have been updated in a routine fashion by upstream.

The regular rocky packages have been updated to address the following:

* rocky-release

  * Add the devel and debuginfo repositories for future state
  * This is provided for mock/buildroot purposes

* rocky-logos

  * Improve icons for future official live images


### Additional Changes

The extras repository for aarch64 has been updated to include various packages that are not included by upstream. Examples of this would be libreoffice and other gnome apps. As they are not in BaseOS or AppStream, the extras repository is the appropriate place for these packages.

* A "devel" repository is now provided for mock/buildroot purposes
* Extras repository for aarch64 has been updated to include missing packages not provided by upstream for desktop use
* rpaste has been updated to accept stdin input
* Older packages will be provided in the repos during the life of a point release.

  * This allows for packages to be downgraded in the case of regressions from upstream or troubleshooting.
