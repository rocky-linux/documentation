# Rocky Linux 8 Change Log

Changelog data for Rocky Linux versions is currently a work in progress. This document deals with where you can find changelog information for version 8. There will be a more formalized approach coming that will include version 9 as well. If you'd like to weigh in on how this information will appear in the future, take a look [at this issue](https://github.com/rocky-linux/peridot/issues/9) and add your comments. In addition, you can find current and historical changes for version 8 [here](https://errata.build.resf.org/).

Updates released since upstream are posted across our current architectures. We strongly recommend that all users apply *all* updates, including the content released today, on your existing Rocky Linux machines. This can be done by running `dnf upgrade`.

All Rocky Linux components are built from the sources hosted at [git.rockylinux.org](https://git.rockylinux.org). In addition, SRPMs are being published alongside the repositories in a corresponding "source" directory. You can find these on any of our mirrors. These source packages match every binary RPM we release.
