# Release notes for Rocky Linux 9.4

You can find a complete list of most changes in the [upstream release notes found here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.4_release_notes/index).

## Upgrading

You can upgrade from Rocky Linux 9.x to Rocky Linux 9.4 by running `sudo dnf -y upgrade`.

!!! Note

    Rocky Linux does not offer an upgrade path from any version of Rocky Linux 8. We recommend doing a fresh OS install to move to Rocky Linux 9.4.

## Images

Several images are available along with the normal install images, including cloud and container platforms.

You can find more on the artifacts produced by the Cloud Special Interest Group, and information on how to get involved on the [SIG/Cloud Wiki page](https://sig-cloud.rocky.page/).

## Installing

Prior to installing, [ensure compatibility of your CPU with this procedure!](https://docs.rockylinux.org/gemstones/test_cpu_compat/)

To install Rocky Linux 9.4, head to the [download page](https://rockylinux.org/download/) and download the version you need for your architecture.

## The Rocky team release highlights

### Cloud and Live Image Updates

#### New image build workflow and process

Most images for the 9.4 release were created using a new image builder: [KIWI](https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi/), from OpenSUSE. The images aim to be feature complete with the old images, and no serious regressions are intended. If you find a bug, please let us know and we will do our best to resolve or explain any differences.

The images still built with imagefactory are: Vagrant-VBox, Vagrant-VMware, and OCP-Base (Oracle Cloud Platform). The remaining Cloud, Container, and Vagrant images were built using KIWI. The new build workflow will enable Rocky Linux to provide more frequent updates to our images on all cloud providers.

You are invited to check out the [KIWI configuration](https://git.resf.org/sig_core/rocky-kiwi-descriptions/src/branch/r9) used as well as our [toolkit](https://git.resf.org/sig_core/toolkit) used to invoke KIWI.

#### Azure - Community Galleries and Publisher Change

The Rocky Linux publisher account for Microsoft Azure has changed, and previous images are now deprecated. For more information, including details on how to migrate to the new account, please visit the [forums post](https://forums.rockylinux.org/t/rocky-linux-images-on-azure-important-update/13721).

In addition to the Azure Marketplace, Rocky Linux is available for free on the Azure Community Gallery, providing incredibly easy access to run Rocky on Microsoft Azure. Instructions on how to utilize the Community Gallery images can be found on this [news post](https://rockylinux.org/news/rocky-on-azure-community-gallery/).
