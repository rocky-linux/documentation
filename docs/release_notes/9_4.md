!!! info "Deprecated Software"

    There are several pacakges that are part of Rocky Linux 9.4 that are end-of-life (EOL). These include (but are not limited to) Node.js 16, .NET 7, and OpenJDK 11. Node.js 16 ended support early (September 2023) so no further updates are available. .NET 7 was EOL on November 8, 2022, with support ending May 14, 2024. OpenJDK 11 was EOL October 18, 2018 with support ending October 2024. If you use software that originates outside of Rocky Linux (as in the included examples), be sure to check the EOL dates of that software and upgrade to newer versions if needed.
