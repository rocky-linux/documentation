!!! info "Some content from the 10.0 release notes deliberately preserved"

    Since this is the first minor release of 10, and since many people wait to upgrade or move to a newer version until after the first minor release, the release notes for 10.1 here include some of the content from the original 10 release that may be of interest to those planning a move to 10.1.

## Rocky Linux 10.1

Rocky Linux 10.1 (RL 10.1) is the latest minor release of Rocky Linux's enterprise operating system.

### Upgrading to Rocky Linux 10.1

To upgrade from 10.0 to 10.1, simply run `dnf -y upgrade`.

Rocky Linux does not support upgrades to any major release. To move from 8.x or 9.x to Rocky Linux 10.x, perform a fresh install of the operating system and restore data from a backup.

### New Features and Changes

The following sections describe selected features of RL 10.1.

As with all Rocky Linux releases, this release note covers numerous enhancements, changes, and new features.

The overview that follows highlights changes in the following categories: Architecture, Kernel, Installer, Networking, Security, Virtualization, Containers, Storage, and Package Management. Chosen here are the features most likely to have relevance to a general audience.

For a complete list of major changes, see the upstream listing [here](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/10/html/10.1_release_notes/overview#overview-major-changes).

### Supported Architectures

!!! warning "Please check CPU Compatibility"

    On the x86_64 processor architecture, RL 10 no longer supports hardware at the x86-64-v2 microarchitecture level and earlier, and makes the x86-64-v3 microarchitecture level the baseline for distribution.  
    For more information, refer to the [Supported Microarchitecture Levels section](#supported-microarchitecture-levels), particularly the section on testing the CPU for compatibility.

!!! info "32-bit package discontinuation"

    Rocky Linux 10 removed 32-bit compatibility for x86_64. Use 64-bit libraries or containers with 32-bit dependencies instead.

Rocky Linux 10.1 is supported on the following processor architectures:

* 64-bit AMD/Intel x86-64-v3 and later (x86_64)
* 64-bit RISC-V (riscv64)
* 64-bit ARMv8.0-A (aarch64)
* IBM POWER10 and later, little endian (ppc64le)
* IBM z15 and later (s390x)

#### Support for RISC-V Architecture

The Rocky Linux release Engineering team worked long and hard to bring Rocky Linux 10 to certain "RISC-V implementations".
Platforms/subsystems supported on release day include - StarFive VisionFive 2 (VF2), **QEMU**, and SiFive HiFive Premier P550.

For more details about this milestone, including RL10’s RISC-V support, please visit [this site](https://rockylinux.org/news/rockylinux-support-for-riscv).

#### Supported Microarchitecture Levels

The x86-64-v3 microarchitecture is based on the feature set of the Intel Haswell processor generation. A handful of Intel Atom processors (such as the Gracemont-family processors) support x86-64-v3. In contrast, others, including Intel Atom Parker Ridge-family processors and the Intel Atom x6416RE Elkhart Lake-family processor, do not provide x86-64-v3 features and are therefore not supported in RL 10. If you doubt your processor's compatibility, [use this procedure](https://docs.rockylinux.org/gemstones/test_cpu_compat/) to verify.

AMD's implementation of the x86-64-v3 microarchitecture level, which serves as the baseline for Rocky Linux 10 on x86_64, was introduced with their Excavator microarchitecture. This means that processors older than those based on the Excavator architecture might not be fully supported by Rocky Linux 10.

!!! Note "Raspberry Pi image differences"

    The key difference between the Rocky Linux Pi images for version 10 is that 10 supports Pi 4 and Pi 5, whereas 9 supports Pi 3, Pi 4, Pi 5, and Pi Zero 2W.

### Installer and Image Creation

Anaconda, the interactive graphical interface for the Rocky Linux installer, has a number of changes in version 10.

Key changes include:

* The disabling, by default, of the root account. System management requires creating an administrative user with full sudo privileges. If you opt to enable the root account by setting its password, then you can create standard users without administrative privileges.
* Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) replaces VNC for graphical remote access during the installation process. This change affects the related kernel boot options.

!!! note "RDP and `xrdp`"

    Since X11 is no-longer supported in the operating system, packages that depend on X11 no-longer exist (`xrdp` for example). Instructions that call for the installation of `xrdp` or `x11vnc` are simply not going to work as is.

* The graphical interface no longer supports adding third-party repositories during initial installation. Use the `inst.addrepo` boot option or Kickstart instead.

Image Builder is now able to create WSL2 and Vagrant (libvirt) images.

### Kernel

The default out-of-box Kernel for RL 10.1 remains 6.12.0.

Some kernel features are now disabled due to being unmaintained, insecure, or deprecated.

The `rh_waived` kernel command-line argument can enable these features if required. Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First (EEVDF), which prioritizes latency-sensitive tasks with shorter time slices to improve responsiveness, replace the CFS scheduler.

### Networking

Enhancements to networking features in RL 10 include changes to network configuration, network interface aggregation, DHCP clients and servers, as well as additions and removals to device drivers.

#### NetworkManager and Network Scripts

Deprecation of the old ifcfg-rh network scripts occurred in previous versions of Rocky Linux (9.x). With Rocky Linux 10, these scripts are no longer available.

You must use NetworkManager now. Those tools include `nmcli`, `nmtui`, and `nmstate`. This means that some older files and commands will no longer work, and the location where you keep your network configuration files has also changed.

* Files with the ifcfg- prefix in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ directory are not supported.
* The ifup and ifdown commands are no longer available.
* Legacy network scripts, such as ifup-local, are no longer supported.
* Network configuration files are stored in the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ folder.

#### DHCP Client and Server

Implementation of the DHCP client in RL 10 is through an internal subsystem of NetworkManager. The legacy dhcp-client package is removed and is no-longer supported upstream.

Kea DHCP replaces the end-of-life ISC DHCP server in RL 10.

#### Network Bonding and Teaming

Previous versions of Rocky Linux deprecated the NIC teaming feature. In RL 10, this is now removed entirely. As a replacement, configure a bond instead of a network team.

### Storage

Several storage-related device drivers are added, updated, or removed from RL 10.

### Security Features

With RL 10, comes the inclusion of numerous new security-related features.

Some of the updates include:

* System-wide cryptographic policies (crypto-policies): PQC algorithms are now enabled in all policies by default.
* Sequoia PGP: Can now be used to sign RPMs.
* OpenSSH: The restoration of stricter SSH host key permissions. (New Permissions = 0600 Vs Old permissions = 0640).
* yescrypt algorithm: The password algorithm for the default user is changed.

### Virtualization

Virtualization sees key changes:

* The monolithic libvirtd daemon is deprecated. Use the modular daemons and sockets as replacements. Please see detailed documentation about the differences in the [upstream documentation](https://libvirt.org/daemons.html#monolithic-vs-modular-daemons)
* Deprecation of the i440fx virtual machine type
* Deprecation of Virtual Machine Manager, Cockpit is the intended replacement

### Containers

Podman 5 in RL 10 introduces several improvements, including the new default container runtime, `crun`, which replaces `runc`. Control Groups v2 is now the default cgroup version.

Key updates include the deprecation of the slirp4netns network mode, the ability to configure retry attempts and delays for image push and pull operations, and comprehensive support for multi-architecture container images.

Furthermore, Podman 5 continues to support Quadlets, a feature introduced in Podman 4.4, which enables managing Podman containers with `systemd` using declarative unit files.

### Software Management

RPM is now version 4.19, Which includes enhancements and updates to packaging and building tools. There is a new `rpmsort` command introduced for correctly ordering RPM version strings in output pipelines. As an example:

The old `sort`: `rpm -q kernel | sort`  
kernel-6.12.0-130.el10.x86_64  
kernel-6.12.0-13.el10.x86_64

The new `rpmsort`: `rpm -q kernel | rpmsort`  
kernel-6.12.0-13.el10.x86_64  
kernel-6.12.0-130.el10.x86_64

#### DNF

By default, DNF now omits downloading repository filelist metadata, enhancing responsiveness and conserving disk space. DNF commands that need this metadata will generally download it automatically.

#### Modularity

DNF modularity is deprecated, and Rocky Linux does not intend to provide AppStream content as modules in RL 10. In the future, RL 10 might provide additional application versions as RPM packages, software collections, or Flatpaks.

In other words, the `dnf module` command has been phased out in RL 10 because the next-generation DNF package manager (`dnf5`) has unified the API and no longer relies on the old modular architecture to manage multiple versions of the software. The relevant comparisons are as follows:

| describe | Old (`dnf module`) | New |
| :---:    | :---:            | :--- |
| View available versions | `dnf module list <moduel-name>` | `dnf repoquery <Name>` |
| Install a specific version | `dnf module enable nginx:1.14 && dnf module install nginx:1.14` | `dnf install nginx-1.26.3` |
| Delete a certain version | `dnf -y module remove --all <module-name>:<stream>` or `dnf -y module remove --all <module-name>:<stream>/<profile>` | `dnf remove <name>-<version>` |
| Switch to a specific version | `dnf -y module remove --all <module-name>:<stream> && dnf module reset <module-name> && dnf module enable <module-name>:<new-stream>` | No need to switch |

### Desktop Environment

In RL 10, Wayland replaces the X.Org Server. Xwayland will support most X11 clients that have not yet been ported to Wayland. Some desktop applications and components are also replaced in RL 10.

#### Desktop Component changes

| Removed | Replacement |
| :---- | :---- |
| gedit text editor | GNOME Text Editor (gnome-text-editor) |
| Tweaks application | Use Tweaks options in GNOME settings and/or use the Flatpak on Flathub |
| Festival speech synthesizer | Espeak NG |
| Eye of GNOME (eog) image viewer | GNOME Image Viewer (loupe) |
| Cheese camera application | Snapshot application |
| GNOME Terminal | ptyxis terminal |
| PulseAudio daemon (but not the client interfaces) | Pipewire (has already been the default in RL 9) |

Several graphical desktop applications are no longer included in the Rocky Linux 10 distribution. In most cases, you can obtain these applications from upstream sources or as Flatpaks on Flathub.

#### Removed Applications

| Removed | Substitution |
| :---- | :---- |
| LibreOffice office productivity software suite | Officially provided as Flatpak on Flathub, or you can download upstream packages from [https://www.libreoffice.org/](https://www.libreoffice.org/). |
| Evolution personal information manager and email client | Thunderbird is provided via the Appstream repository. You can also obtain a Flatpak or package from upstream or through Flathub. |
| Inkscape Vector Graphics Editor | There is no vector graphics editor included in RL 10, but you can find a Flatpak on Flathub. |
| Totem (GNOME Videos) media player | There is no default desktop media player shipped in RL 10. The web browser can still play web-based media. Alternatively, you can choose a different media player from third-party repositories or as a Flatpak from Flathub. |

TigerVNC is removed from RL 10. For VNC client functionality, use the Connections application. There is no VNC server provided.  
gnome-remote-desktop, using RDP, replaces TigerVNC for desktop sharing, remote login, and headless sessions. This is built into GNOME and you can configure it in the Settings application.

The Motif X11 desktop environment and toolkit are also removed from RL 10.

### Infrastructure Services

Replacement or removal of some of the services and packages in RL 10 include the following infrastructure services.

| Removed | Replacement |
| :---- | :---- |
| power-profiles-daemon CPU throttle | tuned-ppd translation layer that supports applications written for the power-profiles-daemon |
| redis in-memory key-value database | <u>valkey</u>[^1] in-memory key-value database |
| sendmail mail transfer agent | Rocky Linux recommends migrating to the Postfix mail transfer agent. |
| spamassassin email spam filter | The spamassassin email spam filter is now found in the EPEL repository. |

[^1]: **valkey**: A fork of redis. 1 In addition to `valkey`, the `valkey-compat-redis` package is in the Plus repository.
