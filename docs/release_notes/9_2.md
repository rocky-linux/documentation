# Release Notes For Rocky Linux 9.2

## Upgrading

You can upgrade from Rocky Linux 9.x to Rocky Linux 9.2 by doing `sudo dnf -y upgrade`

!!! Note

    Rocky Linux does not offer an upgrade path from any version of Rocky Linux 8. We recommend doing a fresh OS install to move to Rocky Linux 9.2.

## Images

As well as the normal install images, there are several images available for new and existing cloud and container platforms.

In addition, images for Oracle Cloud Platform (OCP), GenericCloud, Amazon AWS (EC2), Container RootFS/OCI, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and other CSP-maintained images are available.

The GenericCloud, EC2, and Microsoft Azure images now have a variant that uses an LVM partition for the root filesystem, allowing systems administrators additional flexibility and options for configuring their systems, and the GenericCloud image is also available for ppc64le and s390x.

Vagrant images are now available for x86_64 and aarch64, and container images for all 4 arches.

More information on the artifacts produced by the Cloud Special Interest Group, as well as information on how to get involved can be found on the [SIG/Cloud Wiki page](https://sig-cloud.rocky.page/).

The Cinnamon Live image is new with this release.

## Installing

To install Rocky Linux 9.2, head to the [download page](https://rockylinux.org/download/) and download the version you need for your architecture.

## The Rocky Team Release Highlights

### Breaking Changes

* centos-release-nfv now provides content built on RHEL buildroots instead of centos stream, for compatibility reasons
* The Container Universal Base Images (rockylinux:9-ubi) are changed to be more similar to the RHEL UBI images. This means:
    * `curl-minimal` + `libcurl-minimal` replaces `libcurl`
    * `gzip` got added
    * `gdb-gdbserver` got added
    * `dmidecode` got removed
    * `brotli` got removed
    * `binutils` got removed
    * network config cleanup got added
* Microsoft Azure images are now published in the Shared Galleries as well as in the Marketplace. The shared galleries option provides a direct way to consume Rocky Images on Microsoft Azure without jumping through the hoops of subscribing to the image via the marketplace.
    * In addition, this shared gallery will allow us to publish more frequently updated images to the marketplace
    * The publisher ID for the marketplace images has not changed yet, but we are working to get a new ID for `resf` which is shorter and more memorable 
* LVM Image variants for all types now remove `/etc/lvm/devices/system.devices` to resolve issues with PV/VG/LVs upon installation of the images due to being hardcoded to a specific device new-features-compilers-and-development-tools

### New and Notable

* python 3.11 is available now, and it is not an application stream
* git 2.39 is also here, with support for SSH key signing
* Improved support for Intel Lake Field, Alder Lake N, Raptor Lake, Ice Lake NNPI, and Meteor Lake
* rsyslog privileges got limited, which could affect anyone extending the default logset
* There are 3 new application streams:
    * nginx 1.22
    * postgresql 15
    * swig 4.1 (part of crb)
* The Flatpak bug that breaks all fonts in Flatpaks (Cantarell) got fixed!
* The Kernel version is now 5.14.0-284.11.1
* There is an aarch64 64k kernel now (kernel-64k)
* NFS `nfsrahead` got added
* tomcat 9 is now part of the repos
* Wayland is now enabled by default for Aspeed GPUs
* Intel ARC GPUs should theoretically also work now
* Containers
    * The container-tools RPM meta-package
    * CNI network stack has been deprecated, Aardvark and Netavark are preferred, Netavark is the default for Podman
* Wireguard now works with SELinux again.
