# Release notes for Rocky Linux 9.3

You can find a complete list of most changes in the [upstream release notes found here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.3_release_notes/index).

## Upgrading

You can upgrade from Rocky Linux 9.x to Rocky Linux 9.3 by doing `sudo dnf -y upgrade`.

!!! Note

    Rocky Linux does not offer an upgrade path from any version of Rocky Linux 8. We recommend doing a fresh OS install to move to Rocky Linux 9.3.

## Images

Several images are available along with the normal install images, including cloud and container platforms.

* The 9.3 release brings back cloud and container images for ppc64le that were not released with 9.2 due to issues with QEMU. These images may be divergent from the other architecture's images in some small ways, but we will work to reduce this delta in future releases of the images.

You can find more on the artifacts produced by the Cloud Special Interest Group, and information on how to get involved on the [SIG/Cloud Wiki page](https://sig-cloud.rocky.page/).

## Installing

Prior to installing, [ensure compatibility of your CPU with this procedure!](https://docs.rockylinux.org/gemstones/test_cpu_compat/)

To install Rocky Linux 9.3, head to the [download page](https://rockylinux.org/download/) and download the version you need for your architecture.

## The Rocky team release highlights

### Breaking changes

* The optional `guest-agents` group, previously available within both the *Minimal Install* and *Custom Operating System* base environments in anaconda, is no longer available for selection as additional software for those environments. If you require the guest-agents group, it is available in either the *Server* or *Server with GUI* base environments. If you install *Minimal Install* or *Custom Operating System* and still want guest-agents, you can do so by installing the package target directly in Kickstart, or by installing it with DNF after installation has completed (i.e., `dnf install @guest-agents`).

#### Live Images

* Installing live images for XFCE, MATE, Workstation, and Workstation-Lite, will display an error regarding `NetworkManager-dispatcher.service`. This continues after installation and the service does not load or run. The installation seems to work in all other capacities however. To remove the SELinux messages regarding this service, do a `touch /.autorelabel` followed by a system reboot to silence the SELinux messages. The Cinnamon live image does not display this behavior. 

* The KDE live image for Rocky Linux 9.3 had problems during the testing phase. We will be providing the older 9.2 images until we can build and provide a working image.
