## Release notes for Rocky Linux 9.6

You can find a complete list of most changes in the [upstream release notes found here](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.6_release_notes/index).

## Upgrading

You can upgrade from Rocky Linux 9.x to Rocky Linux 9.6 by running `sudo dnf -y upgrade`.

!!! Note

    Rocky Linux does not offer an upgrade path from any version of Rocky Linux 8. We recommend that you perform a fresh OS installation to upgrade to Rocky Linux 9.6.

## Images

Several images are available, in addition to the standard installation images, including those for cloud and container platforms.

You can find more information on the artifacts produced by the Cloud Special Interest Group, as well as details on how to get involved, on the [SIG/Cloud Wiki page](https://sig-cloud.rocky.page/).

### Image build workflow and process

With the release of Rocky Linux 9.6, the process of building and delivering our images continues to improve. KIWI, a modern image-building tool that allows for a more consistent and maintainable workflow, created most of the images for this release.

Images still built using ImageFactory include Vagrant (Libvirt, VirtualBox, and VMware) and OCP-Base (Oracle Cloud Platform). All other Cloud and Container images are now built with KIWI. This transition enables us to publish updates more frequently across supported platforms while maintaining feature parity with prior releases.

If you encounter any issues or differences in behavior, please notify them. We aim to resolve or explain any unexpected changes quickly.

### New WSL image

The introduction of a new WSL image, in addition to the KIWI upgrades, is also here!  
This makes it possible to use the normal out-of-box experience, which the store-provided images have:

- download the image: [x86_64](https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/images/x86_64/Rocky-9-WSL-Base.latest.x86_64.wsl) or [aarch64](https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/images/aarch64/Rocky-9-WSL-Base.latest.aarch64.wsl)
- to install run `wsl --install --from-file path/to/file.wsl rocky-wsl-base` or just double-click the wsl file
- the first time the wsl image starts it will ask you to specify a username

Find further details in the [documentation page](https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/interoperability/import_rocky_to_wsl/).

## Known issues

### ZFS current module will not load in 9.6

The currently released `zfs` module from OpenZFS **will not load** on Rocky Linux 9.6. For those using `zfs` on 9.5 and planning to upgrade to 9.6, it is recommended to hold off for now. If you are planning a fresh installation of 9.6 and use `zfs`, then you should wait for the release of the updated module again. You can follow the issue [here](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/17332) and [here](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/17364).

### SELinux issue on server, workstation, or virtual host systems with `passt` installed

When using a workstation, server, or virtual host with a `passt` back end installed, the interface will fail to start if SELinux is enabled. See [this upstream issue](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-80407) for more information.

### Upgrade failure with `gstreamer` packages installed

If upgrading a system, you get a failure:

  ```
  Error: Transaction test error:

  ```

Stop the upgrade and do the following before attempting the upgrade again:

  ```
  sudo dnf swap gstreamer1-plugins-ugly-1:1.22.1-1.el9.x86_64 gstreamer1-plugins-ugly-free-1.22.12-3.el9.x86_64 
  sudo dnf swap gstreamer1-plugins-bad-freeworld-1:1.22.1-1.el9.x86_64 gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-1.22.12-4.el9_6.x86_64 
  ```
