## Release notes for Rocky Linux 9.6

You can find a complete list of most changes in the [upstream release notes found here](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.6_release_notes/index).

## Upgrading

You can upgrade from Rocky Linux 9.x to Rocky Linux 9.6 by running `sudo dnf -y upgrade`.

!!! Note

    Rocky Linux does not offer an upgrade path from any version of Rocky Linux 8. We recommend doing a fresh OS install to move to Rocky Linux 9.6.

## Images

Several images are available along with the normal install images, including cloud and container platforms.

You can find more on the artifacts produced by the Cloud Special Interest Group, and information on how to get involved on the [SIG/Cloud Wiki page](https://sig-cloud.rocky.page/).

### Image build workflow and process

With the release of Rocky Linux 9.6, the process of building and delivering our images continues to improve. KIWI, a modern image-building tool that allows for a more consistent and maintainable workflow, created most of the images for this release.

Images still built using ImageFactory include Vagrant (Libvirt, VirtualBox, and VMware) and OCP-Base (Oracle Cloud Platform). All other Cloud and Container images are now built with KIWI. This transition enables us to publish updates more frequently across supported platforms while maintaining feature parity with prior releases.

If you encounter issues or differences in behavior, please report them, we aim to resolve or explain any unexpected changes quickly.

## Installing

Prior to installing, [ensure compatibility of your CPU with this procedure!](https://docs.rockylinux.org/gemstones/test_cpu_compat/)

To install Rocky Linux 9.6, head to the [download page](https://rockylinux.org/download/) and download the version you need for your architecture.

!!! info "User's added at install now have administrative privileges by default"

    Unlike earlier versions of Rocky Linux, when you install a user during install, this user now has administrative privileges by default unless you uncheck the option.

### ZFS current module will not load in 9.6

The currently released `zfs` module from OpenZFS **will not load** on Rocky Linux 9.6. For those using `zfs` on 9.5 and planning to upgrade to 9.6, you should hold off for now. If you are planning a fresh install of 9.6 and use `zfs` then again, you should wait for the release of the updated module. You can follow the issue [here](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/17332) and [here](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/17364).

### SELinux issue on server, workstation, or virtual hosts systems with `passt` installed

When using a workstation, server, or virtual host with a `passt` back end installed, the interface will fail to start if SELinux is enabled. See [this upstream issue](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-80407) for more information.

As with any release, there are many known issues. Review the [upstream listing](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.6_release_notes/known-issues) for the complete details on these issues.

!!! info "Deprecated Software"

    Some Application Streams, which are part of the Rocky Linux 9.6 repositories, will not receive any further updates. This is a normal occurrence that happens with nearly every release. Ensure that you are using the latest supported version of software.
