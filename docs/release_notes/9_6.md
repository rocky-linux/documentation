## Release notes for Rocky Linux 9.6

You can find a complete list of most changes in the [upstream release notes found here](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.6_release_notes/index).

## Upgrading

You can upgrade from Rocky Linux 9.x to Rocky Linux 9.6 by running `sudo dnf -y upgrade`.

!!! Note

    Rocky Linux does not offer an upgrade path from any version of Rocky Linux 8. We recommend doing a fresh OS install to move to Rocky Linux 9.6.

## Images

Several images are available along with the normal install images, including cloud and container platforms.

You can find more on the artifacts produced by the Cloud Special Interest Group, and information on how to get involved on the [SIG/Cloud Wiki page](https://sig-cloud.rocky.page/).

### Image build workflow and process

With the release of Rocky Linux 9.6, the process of building and delivering our images continues to improve. KIWI created most of the images for this release, which is a modern image-building tool that allows for a more consistent and maintainable workflow.

Images still built using ImageFactory include Vagrant (Libvirt, VirtualBox, and VMware) and OCP-Base (Oracle Cloud Platform). All other Cloud and Container images are now built with KIWI. This transition enables us to publish updates more frequently across supported platforms while maintaining feature parity with prior releases.

If you encounter issues or differences in behavior, please report themâ€”we aim to resolve or explain any unexpected changes quickly.

## Installing

Prior to installing, [ensure compatibility of your CPU with this procedure!](https://docs.rockylinux.org/gemstones/test_cpu_compat/)

To install Rocky Linux 9.6, head to the [download page](https://rockylinux.org/download/) and download the version you need for your architecture.
