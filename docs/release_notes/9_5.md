## Upgrading

You can upgrade from Rocky Linux 9.x to Rocky Linux 9.5 by running `sudo dnf -y upgrade`.

## Images

Several images are available along with the normal install images, including cloud and container platforms.

You can find more on the artifacts produced by the Cloud Special Interest Group, and information on how to get involved on the [SIG/Cloud Wiki page](https://sig-cloud.rocky.page/).

## Installing

Prior to installing, [ensure compatibility of your CPU with this procedure!](https://docs.rockylinux.org/gemstones/test_cpu_compat/)

## The Rocky team release highlights

### Cloud and Live Image Updates

#### New image build workflow and process

Most images for the 9.5 release were created using a new image builder: [KIWI](https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi/), from OpenSUSE. The images aim to be feature complete with the old images, and no serious regressions are intended. If you find a bug, please let us know and we will do our best to resolve or explain any differences.

The images still built with imagefactory are: Vagrant-VBox, Vagrant-VMware, and OCP-Base (Oracle Cloud Platform). The remaining Cloud, Container, and Vagrant images were built using KIWI. The new build workflow will enable Rocky Linux to provide more frequent updates to our images on all cloud providers.

You are invited to check out the [KIWI configuration](https://git.resf.org/sig_core/rocky-kiwi-descriptions/src/branch/r9) used as well as our [toolkit](https://git.resf.org/sig_core/toolkit) used to invoke KIWI.
