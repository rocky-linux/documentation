# Release Notes For Rocky Linux 8.8

## Upgrading

You can upgrade from Rocky Linux 8.x to Rocky Linux 8.8 by running `sudo dnf -y upgrade`.

## Images

As well as the normal install images, there are several images available for many cloud and container platforms.

Images for Oracle Cloud Platform (OCP), GenericCloud, Amazon AWS (EC2), Container RootFS/OCI, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and other CSP-maintained images are available. The GenericCloud, EC2, and Microsoft Azure images have a variant that uses an LVM partition for the root filesystem, allowing systems administrators additional flexibility and providing more options for configuring their systems.

Vagrant and container images are available for x86_64 and aarch64. Since the last release we added the `rockylinux/rockylinux:8-ubi-init` variant for usage of systemd in a container. We also added the `rockylinux/rockylinux:8-ubi-micro` variant, which is the most bare-minimum image you can use in self-contained applications without the use of a package manager. We've also added [Toolbox](https://containertoolbx.org/) images for more architectures.

You can find information on the artifacts produced by the Cloud Special Interest Group, as well as information on how to get involved, on the [SIG/Cloud Wiki page](https://sig-cloud.rocky.page/).

The following live images are again available for x86_64: Workstation, Workstation Lite, KDE, XFCE, MATE.

## Installing

To install Rocky Linux 8.8, head to the [download page](https://rockylinux.org/download/) and download the version you need for your architecture.

## The Rocky Team Release Highlights

### Breaking Changes

* Microsoft Azure images are now published in the Shared Image Gallery as well as in the Marketplace. The Shared Image Gallery option provides a direct way to consume Rocky Images on Microsoft Azure without jumping through the hoops of subscribing to the image via the Marketplace. In addition, this Shared Image Gallery will allow us to publish more frequently-updated images to the Marketplace.
* LVM cloud image variants for all types now remove `/etc/lvm/devices/system.devices` to resolve issues with PV/VG/LVs upon installation of the images due to being hardcoded to a specific device.
* The **Container Universal Base Image** `rockylinux/rockylinux:8-ubi` is changed to be more similar to the RHEL UBI images. This means the following changes were made:

    * Replaced packages: `libcurl` -> `curl-minimal`, `libcurl-minimal`
    * Added packages: `gdb-gdbserver`, `gzip`
    * Removed packages: `binutils`, `brotli`, `dmidecode`
    * network config cleanup added
