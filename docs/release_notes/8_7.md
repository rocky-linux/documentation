# Release Notes for Rocky Linux 8.7

!!! note "Minimal ISO"

    The minimal ISO does not contain the Appstream repository. This means that packages that come from Appstream (rsyslog, policycoreutils-python-utils, etc.) will not exist after an install of the Minimal ISO. This is not a bug and is to be expected.

## Upgrading From Any Rocky Linux 8 Version

Simply run `sudo dnf -y upgrade`

## Cloud Images

As well as the normal install images, there are several images available for cloud platforms. (Neil fill this in)

## Known Issues

There are no known issues currently found in 8.7. We will add them here later if they show up after the release.
