# Release Notes for Rocky Linux 8.5

## Thank You

Thank you for supporting Rocky Linux. These are the release notes for Rocky Linux 8.5, available for x86_64 and aarch64 (ARM) architectures.

>There was an amazing amount of work and collaboration that went into this release. The Rocky Release Engineering team went far and above the call of duty to make 8.5 a reality so quickly. Please send them gratitude, happy thoughts, and lotsa beers at our first available moment!

â€” Gregory Kurtzer

### Major Changes

For a full listing of all changes which occurred upstream, please reference the [Release Notes for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.5_release_notes/overview#overview-major-changes).

#### **Secure Boot**

In less than 48 hours from RHEL-8.5 being released, we had successful tests on our ISOs and just before we were about to pull the string to go GA with 8.5, Microsoft countersigned our Secure Boot shim. We quickly deliberated and decided to backtrack and incorporate that into the 8.5 release.

There were some things that we had to get in order and resolved, but it is with great pleasure that this release includes the official Rocky Linux signed shim. Here is the full thread to the shim review: [https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/issues/194](https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/issues/194).

As with any security related diligence, it is important to be able to validate the Secure Boot shim is exactly what you expect and that it is properly activated. After installing Rocky Linux 8.5, please log in and run these commands to validate our secure boot shim:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y keyutils

sudo keyctl show %:.platform

sudo mokutil --sb
```

These commands should produce output similar to the following:

```bash

[user@localhost ~]# sudo keyctl show %:.platform

#### Fastest Mirrors

During network installation, the list of mirrors hosting BaseOS content from the MirrorList will be used by the FastestMirror DNF plugin, sorted heuristically by the time it takes to open a connection to the mirrors on their given protocol's port ([Source code](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/yum-utils/blob/master/plugins/fastestmirror/fastestmirror.py)).

This change means that a Repository URL is no longer required when using Boot-only media and performing Network-based installations of Rocky (and other Enterprise) Linux!
