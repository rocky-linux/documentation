# Release Notes For Rocky Linux 9.1

## Upgrading

You can upgrade from Rocky Linux 9.0 to Rocky Linux 9.1 by simply running `sudo dnf -y upgrade`

!!! note

    Rocky Linux does not offer an upgrade path from any version of Rocky Linux 8. We recommend doing a fresh OS install to move to Rocky Linux 9.x.

## Image changes

As well as the normal install images, there are several images available for new and existing cloud and container platforms.

In between Rocky Linux 9.0 and 9.1, images for Oracle Cloud Platform (OCP) were developed and released. The Oracle images join our existing set of images including GenericCloud, Amazon AWS (EC2), Container RootFS/OCI, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and other CSP-maintained images.

Additionally, the GenericCloud, EC2, and Azure images now have a variant which uses an LVM partition for the root filesystem, allowing systems administrators additional flexibility and options for configuring their systems. And the GenericCloud image is also available for ppc64le and s390x now!

Also the build pipeline for the container (Base, Minimal, and UBI) and Vagrant (Libvirt, VirtualBox, and VMWare) images got overhauled. Vagrant images are now available for x86_64 and aarch64, and container images for all 4 arches.

More information on the artifacts produced by the Cloud Special Interest Group, as well as information on how to get involved can be found on the [SIG/Cloud Wiki](https://sig-cloud.rocky.page/) page.
