# PAM Authentication Modules

## Prerequisites and Assumptions

* A non-critical Rocky Linux PC, server, or VM
* Root access
* Some existing Linux knowledge (would help a lot)
* A desire to learn about user and app authentication on Linux
* The ability to accept the consequences of your own actions

## Introduction

PAM (**Pluggable Authentication Modules**) is the system under GNU/Linux that allows many applications or services to authenticate users in a centralized fashion. To put it another way:

> PAM is a library suite that allows a Linux system administrator to configure methods to authenticate users. It provides a flexible and centralized way to switch authentication methods for secured applications using configuration files instead of changing application code. 
> \- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM)

This document is *not* designed to teach you exactly how to harden your machine. It is more of a reference guide to show you what PAM *can* do, and not what you *should* do.

## Generalities

Authentication is the phase during which it is verified that you are the person you claim to be. The most common example is the password, but other forms of authentication exist.

![PAM generalities](images/pam-001.png)

Implementing a new authentication method should not require changes in source code for program or service configuration. This is why applications rely on PAM, which gives them the primitives* necessary to authenticate their users.

All the applications in a system can thus implement complex functionalities such as **SSO** (Single Sign On), **OTP** (One Time Password) or **Kerberos** in a completely transparent manner. A system administrator can choose exactly which authentication policy is to be used for a single application (e.g. to harden the SSH service) independently of the application.

Each application or service supporting PAM will have a corresponding configuration file in the `/etc/pam.d/` directory. For example, the process `login` assigns the name `/etc/pam.d/login` to its configuration file.

\* Primitives are literally the simplest elements of a program or language, allowing you to build more sophisticated and complex things on top of them.

!!! WARNING

    A misconfigured instance of PAM can compromise the security of your whole system. If PAM is vulnerable, then the whole system is vulnerable. Make any changes with care.

## Directives

A directive is used to set up an application for usage with PAM. Directives will follow this format:

```
mechanism [control] path-to-module [argument]
```

A **directive** (a complete line) is composed of a **mechanism** (`auth`, `account`, `password` or `session`), a **success check** (`include`, `optional`, `required`, ...), the **path to the module** and possibly **arguments** (like `revoke` for example).

Each PAM configuration file contains a set of directives. The module interface directives can be stacked or placed on top of each other. In fact, **the order in which the modules are listed is very important to the authentication process.**

For example, here's the config file `/etc/pam.d/sudo`:

```
#%PAM-1.0
auth       include      system-auth
account    include      system-auth
password   include      system-auth
session    include      system-auth
```

## Mechanisms

### `auth` - Authentication

This handles the authentication of the requester and establishes the rights of the account:

* Usually authenticates with a password by comparing it to a value stored in a database, or by relying on an authentication server,

* Establishes account settings: uid, gid, groups, and resource limits.

### `account` - Account management

Checks that the requested account is available:

* Relates to the availability of the account for reasons other than authentication (e.g. for time restrictions).

### `session` - Session management

Relates to session setup and termination:

* Performs tasks associated with session setup (e.g. logging),
* Performs tasks associated with session termination.

### `password` - Password management

Used to modify the authentication token associated with an account (expiration or change):

* Changes the authentication token and possibly verifies that it is robust enough or has not already been used.

## Control Indicators

The PAM mechanisms (`auth`, `account`, `session` and `password`) indicate `success` or `failure`. The control flags (`required`, `requisite`, `sufficient`, `optional`) tell PAM how to handle this result.

### `required`

Successful completion of all `required` modules is necessary.

* **If the module passes:** The rest of the chain is executed. The request is allowed unless other modules fail.

* **If the module fails:** The rest of the chain is executed. Finally the request is rejected.

The module must be successfully verified for the authentication to continue. If the verification of a module marked `required` fails, the user is not notified until all modules associated with that interface have been verified.

### `requisite`

Successful completion of all `requisite` modules is necessary.

* **If the module passes:** The rest of the chain is executed. The request is allowed unless other modules fail.

* **If the module fails:** The request is immediately rejected.

The module must be successfully verified for authentication to continue. However, if the verification of a `requisite`-marked module fails, the user is immediately notified by a message indicating the failure of the first `required` or `requisite` module.

### `sufficient`

Modules marked `sufficient` can be used to let a user in "early" under certain conditions:

* **If the module succeeds:** The authentication request is immediately allowed if none of the previous modules failed.

* **If the module fails:** The module is ignored. The rest of the chain is executed.

However, if a module check marked `sufficient` is successful, but modules marked `required` or `requisite` have failed their checks, the success of the `sufficient` module is ignored, and the request fails.

### `optional`

The module is executed but the result of the request is ignored. If all modules in the chain were marked `optional`, all requests would always be accepted.

### Conclusion

## PAM modules

There are many modules for PAM. Here are the most common ones:

* pam_unix
* pam_ldap
* pam_wheel
* pam_cracklib
* pam_console
* pam_tally
* pam_securetty
* pam_nologin
* pam_limits
* pam_time
* pam_access

### `pam_unix`

The `pam_unix` module allows you to manage the global authentication policy.

In `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` you might add:

```
password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512 nullok
```

Arguments are possible for this module:

* `nullok`: in the `auth` mechanism allows an empty login password.
* `sha512`: in the password mechanism, defines the encryption algorithm.
* `debug`: sends information to `syslog`.
* `remember=n`: Use this to remember the last `n` passwords used (works in conjunction with the `/etc/security/opasswd` file, which is to be created by the administrator).

### `pam_cracklib`

The `pam_cracklib` module allows you to test passwords.

In `/etc/pam.d/password-auth` add:

```
password sufficient pam_cracklib.so retry=2
```

This module uses the `cracklib` library to check the strength of a new password. It can also check that the new password is not built from the old one. It *only* affects the password mechanism.

By default this module checks the following aspects and rejects if this is the case:

* Is the new password from the dictionary?
* Is the new password a palindrome of the old one (e.g.: azerty <> ytreza)?
* Has the user only changed the password case (e.g.: azerty <>AzErTy)?

Possible arguments for this module:

* `retry=n`: imposes `n` requests (1` by default) for the new password.
* `difok=n`: imposes at least `n` characters (`10` by default), different from the old password. If half of the characters of the new password are different from the old one, the new password is validated.
* `minlen=n`: imposes a password of `n+1` characters minimum. You cannot assign a minimum lower than 6 characters (the module is compiled this way).

Other possible arguments:

* `dcredit=-n`: imposes a password containing at least `n` digits,
* `ucredit=-n`: imposes a password containing at least `n` capital letters,
* `credit=-n`: imposes a password containing at least `n` lower case letters,
* `ocredit=-n`: imposes a password containing at least `n` special characters.

### `pam_tally`

The `pam_tally` module allows you to lock an account based on a number of unsuccessful login attempts.

The default config file for this module might look like: `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`:

```
auth required /lib/security/pam_tally.so onerr=fail no_magic_root
account required /lib/security/pam_tally.so deny=3 reset no_magic_root
```

The `auth` mechanism accepts or denies authentication and resets the counter.

The `account` mechanism increments the counter.

Some arguments of the pam_tally module include:

* `onerr=fail`: increments the counter.
* `deny=n`: once the number `n` of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded, the account is locked.
* `no_magic_root`: can be used to deny access to root-level services launched by daemons. 
    * e.g. don't use this for `su`.
* `reset`: resets the counter to 0 if the authentication is validated.
* `lock_time=nsec`: the account is locked for `n` seconds.

This module works together with the default file for unsuccessful attempts `/var/log/faillog` (which can be replaced by another file with the argument `file=xxxx`), and the associated command `faillog`.

Syntax of the faillog command:

```
faillog[-m n] |-u login][-r]
```

Options:

* `m`: to define, in the command display, the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts,
* `u`: to specify a user,
* `r`: to unlock a user.

### `pam_time`

The `pam_time` module allows you to limit the access times to services managed by PAM.

To activate it, edit `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` and add:

```
account required /lib/security/pam_time.so
```

The configuration is done in the `/etc/security/time.conf` file:

```
login ; * ; users ;MoTuWeThFr0800-2000
http ; * ; users ;Al0000-2400
```

The syntax of a directive is as follows:

```
services; ttys; users; times
```

In the following definitions, the logical list uses:

* `&`: is the "and" logical.
* `|`: is the "or" logical.
* `!`: means negation, or "all except".
* `*`: is the wildcard character.

The columns correspond to:

* `services`: a logical list of services managed by PAM that are also to be managed by this rule
* `ttys`: a logical list of related devices
* `users`: logical list of users managed by the rule
* `times`: a logical list of authorized time slots

How to manage time slots:

* Days: `Mo`, `Tu`, `We`, `Th`, `Fr,` `Sa`, `Su`, `Wk`, (Monday to Friday), `Wd` (Saturday and Sunday), and `Al` (Monday to Sunday)
* The hourly range: `HHMM-HHMM`
* A repetition cancels the effect: `WkMo` = all days of the week (M-F), minus Monday (repeat).

Examples:

* Bob, can login via a terminal every day between 07:00 and 09:00, except Wednesday:

```
login; tty*; bob; alth0700-0900
```

No login, terminal or remote, except root, every day of the week between 17:30 and 7:45 the next day:

```
login; tty* | pts/*; !root; !wk1730-0745
```

### `pam_nologin`

The `pam_nologin` module disables all accounts except root:

In `/etc/pam.d/login` you'd put:

```
auth required pam_nologin.so
```

Only root can connect if the file `/etc/nologin` exists and is readable.

### `pam_wheel`

The `pam_wheel` module allows you to limit the access to the `su` command to the members of the `wheel` group.

In `/etc/pam.d/su` you'd put:

```
auth required pam_wheel.so
```

The argument `group=my_group` limits the use of the `su` command to members of the group `my_group`

!!! NOTE

    If the group `my_group` is empty, then the `su` command is no longer available on the system, which forces the use of the sudo command.

### `pam_mount`

The `pam_mount` module allows you to mount a volume for a user session.

In `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` you'd put:

```
auth optional pam_mount.so
password optional pam_mount.so
session optional pam_mount.so
```

Mount points are configured in the `/etc/security/pam_mount.conf` file:

```
<volume fstype="nfs" server="srv" path="/home/%(USER)" mountpoint="~" />
<volume user="bob" fstype="smbfs" server="filesrv" path="public" mountpoint="/public" />
```

## Wrapping Up

By now, you should have a much better idea of what PAM can do, and how to make changes when needed. However, we must reiterate the importance of being very, *very* careful with any changes you make to PAM modules. You could lock yourself out of your system, or worse, let everyone else in.

We would strongly recommend testing all changes in an environment that can be easily reverted to a previous configuration. That said, have fun with it!
