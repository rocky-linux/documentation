## Overview

`dump` examines files in a filesystem, determines which to back up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape, or other storage medium. The `restore` command performs the inverse function of `dump`.

This utility applies to the following file systems:

* ext2
* ext3
* ext4

!!! tip

    For the xfs file system, use `xfsdump`.

[This](https://dump.sourceforge.io/) is the project's homepage.

Before using this utility, run the following command to install it:

```bash
Shell > dnf -y install dump
```

After installation, two commonly used command tools are available:

* `dump`
* `restore`

### `dump` command

There are two main uses for this command:

* Perform backup (dump) operations - `dump [option(s)] -f <File-Name> <File1> ...`
* Review backup (dump) information - `dump [-W | -w]`

Common options are:

* `-<level>` - Backup level. Please replace "level" with any number from 0-9 when used. The number 0 represents full backup, while other numbers represent incremental backup.
* `-f <File-Name>` - Specify the file name and path after backup.
* `-u` - After a successful backup, record the backup time in the **/etc/dumpdates** file. You can use the `-u` option when the backed-up object is an independent partition. However, you cannot use the `-u` option when the backup object is a non-partitioned directory.
* `-v` - Display the processing details during the backup process.
* `-W` - An option for viewing dump information.
* `-z[LEVEL]` - Adjust the compression level using the zlib library, with a default compression level of 2. For example, you can compress the backup file to `.gz` format. The adjustable range of compression level is 1-9.
* `-j[LEVEL]` - Adjust the compression level using the bzlib library, with a default compression level of 2. For example, you can compress the backup file to `.bz2` format. The adjustable range of compression level is 1-9.

#### Example of using `dump`

1. Perform a Full Backup of the root partition:

    ```bash
    Shell > dump -0u -j3 -f /tmp/root-20241208.bak.bz2 /
    DUMP: Date of this level 0 dump: Sun Dec  8 19:04:39 2024
    DUMP: Dumping /dev/nvme0n1p2 (/) to /tmp/root-20241208.bak.bz2
    DUMP: Label: none
    DUMP: Writing 10 Kilobyte records
    DUMP: Compressing output at transformation level 3 (bzlib)
    DUMP: mapping (Pass I) [regular files]
    DUMP: mapping (Pass II) [directories]
    DUMP: estimated 14693111 blocks.
    DUMP: Volume 1 started with block 1 at: Sun Dec  8 19:04:41 2024
    DUMP: dumping (Pass III) [directories]
    DUMP: dumping (Pass IV) [regular files]

    DUMP: 43.74% done at 10712 kB/s, finished in 0:12
    DUMP: 70.91% done at 11575 kB/s, finished in 0:06
    DUMP: 93.23% done at 11415 kB/s, finished in 0:01
    DUMP: Closing /tmp/root-20241208.bak.bz2
    DUMP: Volume 1 completed at: Sun Dec  8 19:26:08 2024

    DUMP: Volume 1 transfer rate: 5133 kB/s
    DUMP: Volume 1 14722930kB uncompressed, 6607183kB compressed, 2.229:1
    DUMP: 14722930 blocks (14377.86MB) on 1 volume(s)
    DUMP: finished in 1287 seconds, throughput 11439 kBytes/sec
    DUMP: Date of this level 0 dump: Sun Dec  8 19:04:39 2024
    DUMP: Date this dump completed:  Sun Dec  8 19:26:08 2024
    DUMP: Average transfer rate: 5133 kB/s
    DUMP: Wrote 14722930kB uncompressed, 6607183kB compressed, 2.229:1
    DUMP: DUMP IS DONE

    Shell > ls -lh /tmp/root-20241208.bak.bz2
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6.4G Dec  8 19:26 /tmp/root-20241208.bak.bz2
    ```

2. After successful dumping, check the relevant information:

    ```bash
    Shell > cat /etc/dumpdates
    /dev/nvme0n1p2 0 Sun Dec  8 19:04:39 2024 +0800

    Shell > dump -W
    Last dump(s) done (Dump '>' file systems):
    /dev/nvme0n1p2        (     /) Last dump: Level 0, Date Sun Dec  8 19:04:39 2024
    ```

3. Implement Incremental Backup on the basis of Full Backup:

    ```bash
    Shell > echo "jack" >> /tmp/tmpfile.txt

    Shell > dump -1u -j4 -f /tmp/root-20241208-LV1.bak.bz2 /
    DUMP: Date of this level 1 dump: Sun Dec  8 19:38:51 2024
    DUMP: Date of last level 0 dump: Sun Dec  8 19:04:39 2024
    DUMP: Dumping /dev/nvme0n1p2 (/) to /tmp/root-20241208-LV1.bak.bz2
    DUMP: Label: none
    DUMP: Writing 10 Kilobyte records
    DUMP: Compressing output at transformation level 4 (bzlib)
    DUMP: mapping (Pass I) [regular files]
    DUMP: mapping (Pass II) [directories]
    DUMP: estimated 6620898 blocks.
    DUMP: Volume 1 started with block 1 at: Sun Dec  8 19:38:58 2024
    DUMP: dumping (Pass III) [directories]
    DUMP: dumping (Pass IV) [regular files]
    DUMP: 38.13% done at 8415 kB/s, finished in 0:08
    DUMP: 75.30% done at 8309 kB/s, finished in 0:03
    DUMP: Closing /tmp/root-20241208-LV1.bak.bz2
    DUMP: Volume 1 completed at: Sun Dec  8 19:52:03 2024
    DUMP: Volume 1 took 0:13:05
    DUMP: Volume 1 transfer rate: 8408 kB/s
    DUMP: Volume 1 6620910kB uncompressed, 6600592kB compressed, 1.004:1
    DUMP: 6620910 blocks (6465.73MB) on 1 volume(s)
    DUMP: finished in 785 seconds, throughput 8434 kBytes/sec
    DUMP: Date of this level 1 dump: Sun Dec  8 19:38:51 2024
    DUMP: Date this dump completed:  Sun Dec  8 19:52:03 2024
    DUMP: Average transfer rate: 8408 kB/s
    DUMP: Wrote 6620910kB uncompressed, 6600592kB compressed, 1.004:1
    DUMP: DUMP IS DONE

    Shell > cat /etc/dumpdates
    /dev/nvme0n1p2 0 Sun Dec  8 19:04:39 2024 +0800
    /dev/nvme0n1p2 1 Sun Dec  8 19:38:51 2024 +0800

    Shell > dump -W
    Last dump(s) done (Dump '>' file systems):
    /dev/nvme0n1p2        (     /) Last dump: Level 1, Date Sun Dec  8 19:38:51 2024
    ```

4. For non-partitioned directory, you can only use the Full Backup (`-0`) option, not the `-u` option:

    ```bash
    Shell > dump -0uj -f /tmp/etc-full-20241208.bak.bz2 /etc/
    DUMP: You can't update the dumpdates file when dumping a subdirectory
    DUMP: The ENTIRE dump is aborted.

    Shell > dump -0j -f /tmp/etc-full-20241208.bak.bz2 /etc/
    DUMP: Date of this level 0 dump: Sun Dec  8 20:00:38 2024
    DUMP: Dumping /dev/nvme0n1p2 (/ (dir etc)) to /tmp/etc-full-20241208.bak.bz2
    DUMP: Label: none
    DUMP: Writing 10 Kilobyte records
    DUMP: Compressing output at transformation level 2 (bzlib)
    DUMP: mapping (Pass I) [regular files]
    DUMP: mapping (Pass II) [directories]
    DUMP: estimated 28204 blocks.
    DUMP: Volume 1 started with block 1 at: Sun Dec  8 20:00:38 2024
    DUMP: dumping (Pass III) [directories]
    DUMP: dumping (Pass IV) [regular files]
    DUMP: Closing /tmp/etc-full-20241208.bak.bz2
    DUMP: Volume 1 completed at: Sun Dec  8 20:00:40 2024
    DUMP: Volume 1 took 0:00:02
    DUMP: Volume 1 transfer rate: 3751 kB/s
    DUMP: Volume 1 29090kB uncompressed, 7503kB compressed, 3.878:1
    DUMP: 29090 blocks (28.41MB) on 1 volume(s)
    DUMP: finished in 2 seconds, throughput 14545 kBytes/sec
    DUMP: Date of this level 0 dump: Sun Dec  8 20:00:38 2024
    DUMP: Date this dump completed:  Sun Dec  8 20:00:40 2024
    DUMP: Average transfer rate: 3751 kB/s
    DUMP: Wrote 29090kB uncompressed, 7503kB compressed, 3.878:1
    DUMP: DUMP IS DONE
    ```

   Performing an incremental backup of the /etc/ directory will result in an error:

    ```bash
    Shell > dump -1j -f /tmp/etc-incr-20241208.bak.bz2 /etc/
    DUMP: Only level 0 dumps are allowed on a subdirectory
    DUMP: The ENTIRE dump is aborted.
    ```

### `restore` command

The usage of this command is - `restore <mode(flag)> [option(s)] -f <Dump-File>`

The mode (flag) can be one of the following:

* `-C` - Comparison mode. Restore reads the backup and compares its contents with files on the disk. It is mainly used to compare after performing a backup on a partition. In this mode, `restore` only compares changes based on the original data. If there is new data on the disk, you cannot compare or detect it.
* `-i` - Interactive mode. This mode allows interactive restoration of files from a dump.
* `-t` - List mode. List what data is in the backup file.
* `-r` - Restore (rebuild) mode. If it is a "Full Backup + Incremental Backup" method, restoring data will occur chronologically.
* `-x` - Extraction mode. Extract some or all files from the backup file.

#### Example of using `restore`

1. Restore data from /tmp/etc-full-20241208.bak.bz2 :

    ```bash
    Shell > mkdir /tmp/data/

    Shell > restore -t -f /tmp/etc-full-20241208.bak.bz2

    Shell > cd /tmp/data/ ; restore -r -f /tmp/etc-full-20241208.bak.bz2

    Shell > ls -l /tmp/data/
    total 4992
    drwxr-xr-x. 90 root root    4096 Dec  8 17:13 etc
    -rw-------   1 root root 5107632 Dec  8 20:39 restoresymtable
    ```

    As you can see, a file named `restoresymtable` shows up after a successful restore. This file is important. It is for incremental backup system restore operations.

2. Process backup files in Interactive mode:

    ```bash
    Shell > restore -i -f /tmp/etc-full-20241208.bak.bz2
    Dump tape is compressed.
    
    restore > ?
    ```
