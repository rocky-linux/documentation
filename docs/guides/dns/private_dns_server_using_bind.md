# Private DNS Server Using Bind

## Prerequisites and Assumptions

* A server running Rocky Linux
* Several internal servers that need to be accessed only locally, but not over the Internet
* Several workstations that need access to these same servers that exist on the same network
* A healthy comfort level with entering commands from command line
* Familiarity with a command line editor (we are using _vi_ in this example)
* Able to use either _firewalld_ or _iptables_ for creating firewall rules. We've provided both _iptables_ and _firewalld_ options. If you plan to use _iptables_, use the [Enabling Iptables Firewall procedure](../security/enabling_iptables_firewall.md)

## Introduction

External, or public, DNS servers are used on the Internet to map host names to IP addresses and, in the case of PTR (known as "pointer" or "reverse") records, to map the IP to the host name. This is an essential part of the Internet. It makes your mail server, web server, FTP server, or many other servers and services work as expected no matter where you are.

On a private network, particularly one that is being used for developing multiple systems, you can use your Rocky Linux workstation's */etc/hosts* file to map a name to an IP address.

This will work for _your_ workstation, but not for any other machine on your network. If you want to make things universally applied, then the best method is to take some time out and create a local, private DNS server to handle this for all of your machines.

If you were creating production-level public DNS servers and resolvers, then this author would probably recommend the more robust [PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/) authoritative and recursive DNS, which is easily installed on Rocky Linux servers. However, that is simply overkill for a local network that won't be exposing its DNS servers to the outside world. That is why we have chosen _bind_ for this example.

### The DNS Server Components Explained

As stated, DNS separates services into authoritative and recursive servers. These services are now recommended to be separate from each other on separate hardware or containers.

The authoritative server is the storage area for all IP addresses and host names, and the recursive server is used to lookup addresses and host names. In the case of our private DNS server, both the authoritative and the recursive server services will run together.

## Installing and Enabling Bind

The first step is to install packages. In the case of _bind_ we need to execute the following command:

```
dnf install bind bind-utils
```

The service daemon for _bind_ is called _named_, and we need to enable this to start on boot:

```
systemctl enable named
```

And then we need to start it:

```
systemctl start named
```

## Configuration

Before making changes to any configuration file, it is a good idea to make a backup copy of the original installed working file, in this case _named.conf_:

```
cp /etc/named.conf /etc/named.conf.orig
```

That will help in the future if errors are introduced into the configuration file. It is *always* a good idea to make a backup copy before making changes.

These changes require us to edit the named.conf file, to do this, we are using _vi_, but you can substitute your favorite command line editor (the editor `nano` is also installed in Rocky Linux and is easier to use than `vi`):

```
vi /etc/named.conf
```

First thing we want to do is turn off listening on the localhost, this is done by remarking out with a "#" sign, these two lines in the "options" section. What this does is to effectively shut down any connection to the outside world.

This is helpful, particularly when we go to add this DNS to our workstations, because we want the DNS server to only respond when the IP address requesting the service is local, and simply not respond at all if the service that is being looked up is on the Internet.

This way, the other configured DNS servers will take over nearly immediately to look up the Internet based services:

```
options {
#       listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; };
#       listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };
```

Finally, skip down to the bottom of the *named.conf* file and add a section for your network. Our example is using ourdomain, so sub in what you want to call your LAN hosts:

```
# primary forwward and reverse zones
//forward zone
zone "ourdomain.lan" IN {
     type master;
     file "ourdomain.lan.db";
     allow-update { none; };
    allow-query {any; };
};
//reverse zone
zone "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa" IN {
     type master;
     file "ourdomain.lan.rev";
     allow-update { none; };
    allow-query { any; };
};
```

Now save your changes (for _vi_, `SHIFT:wq!`)

## The Forward and Reverse Records

Next, we need to create two files in `/var/named`. These files are the ones that you will edit if you add machines to your network that you want to include in the DNS.

The first is the forward file to map our IP address to the hostname. Again, we are using "ourdomain" as our example here. Note that the IP of our local DNS here is 192.168.1.136. The hosts are added at the bottom of this file.

```
vi /var/named/ourdomain.lan.db
```

The file will look something like this when you are done:

```
$TTL 86400
@ IN SOA dns-primary.ourdomain.lan. admin.ourdomain.lan. (
    2019061800 ;Serial
    3600 ;Refresh
    1800 ;Retry
    604800 ;Expire
    86400 ;Minimum TTL
)

;Name Server Information
@ IN NS dns-primary.ourdomain.lan.

;IP for Name Server
dns-primary IN A 192.168.1.136

;A Record for IP address to Hostname
wiki IN A 192.168.1.13
www IN A 192.168.1.14
devel IN A 192.168.1.15
```

Add as many hosts as you need to the bottom of the file along with their IP addresses and then save your changes.

Next, we need a reverse file to map our hostname to the IP address, In this case, the only part of the IP that you need is the last octet (in an IPv4 address each number separated by a period, is an octet) of the host and then the PTR and hostname.

```
vi /var/named/ourdomain.lan.rev
```

And the file should look something like this when you are done.:

```
$TTL 86400
@ IN SOA dns-primary.ourdomain.lan. admin.ourdomain.lan. (
    2019061800 ;Serial
    3600 ;Refresh
    1800 ;Retry
    604800 ;Expire
    86400 ;Minimum TTL
)
;Name Server Information
@ IN NS dns-primary.ourdomain.lan.

;Reverse lookup for Name Server
136 IN PTR dns-primary.ourdomain.lan.

;PTR Record IP address to HostName
13 IN PTR wiki.ourdomain.lan.
14 IN PTR www.ourdomain.lan.
15 IN PTR devel.ourdomain.lan.
```

Add all of the hostnames that appear in the forward file and then save your changes.

### What All Of This Means

Now that we have all of this added in and are preparing to restart our _bind_ DNS server, let's just explore some of the terminology that is used in these two files.

Just making things work isn't good enough if you don't know what each term means, right?

* **TTL** appears in both files and it stands for "Time To Live". TTL tells the DNS server how long to keep its cache in place before requesting a fresh copy. In this case, the TTL is the default setting for all records unless a specific record TTL is set. The default here is 86400 seconds or 24 hours.
* **IN** stands for Internet. In this case, we aren't actually using the Internet, so think of this as the Intranet.
* **SOA** stands for "Start Of Authority" or what the primary DNS server is for the domain.
* **NS** stands for "name server"
* **Serial** is the value used by the DNS server to verify that the contents of the zone file are up-to-date.
* **Refresh** specifies how often a slave DNS server should do a zone transfer from the master.
* **Retry** specifies the length of time in seconds to wait before trying again on a failed zone transfer.
* **Expire** specifies how long a slave server should wait to answer a query when the master is unreachable.
* **A** Is the host address or forward record and is only in the forward file (above).
* **PTR** Is the pointer record better known as the "reverse" and is only in our reverse file (above).

## Testing Configurations

Once we have gotten all of our files created, we need to make sure that the configuration files and zones are in good working order before we start the _bind_ service again.

Check the main configuration:

```
named-checkconf
```

This should return an empty result if everything is OK.

Then check the forward zone:

```
named-checkzone ourdomain.lan /var/named/ourdomain.lan.db
```

This should return something like this if all is well:

```
zone ourdomain.lan/IN: loaded serial 2019061800
OK
```

And finally check the reverse zone:

```
named-checkzone 192.168.1.136 /var/named/ourdomain.lan.rev
```

Which should return something like this if all is well:

```
zone 192.168.1.136/IN: loaded serial 2019061800
OK
```

Assuming that everything looks good, go ahead and restart _bind_:

```
systemctl restart named
```

=== "9"

    ## 9 Using IPv4 On Your LAN

    In order to use ONLY IPv4 on your LAN, you need to make one change in `/etc/sysconfig/named`:

    ```
    vi /etc/sysconfig/named
    ```
    and then add this at the bottom of the file:

    ```
    OPTIONS="-4"
    ```
    
    Now save those changes (again, for _vi_, `SHIFT:wq!`)

    ## 9 Testing Machines

    You need to add the DNS server (in our example 192.168.1.136) to each machine that you want to have access to the servers that you added to your local DNS. We are only going to show you an example of how to do this on a Rocky Linux workstation, but there are similar methods for other Linux distributions, as well as Windows and Mac machines.

    Keep in mind that you will want to just add the DNS servers to the list, not replace what is currently there, as you will still need Internet access, which will require your currently assigned DNS servers. These might be assigned via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) or statically assigned.

    We will add our local DNS with `nmcli` and then restart the connection. 

    ??? warning "Stupid Profile Names"

        In NetworkManager, the connections are not modified by the name of the device but by the name of the profile. This can be things like "Wired connection 1" or "Wireless connection 1". You can see the profile by running `nmcli` without any parameters:

        ```
        nmcli
        ```
        
        This will show you output such as this:

        ```bash
        enp0s3: connected to Wired Connection 1
        "Intel 82540EM"
        ethernet (e1000), 08:00:27:E4:2D:3D, hw, mtu 1500
        ip4 default
        inet4 192.168.1.140/24
        route4 192.168.1.0/24 metric 100
        route4 default via 192.168.1.1 metric 100
        inet6 fe80::f511:a91b:90b:d9b9/64
        route6 fe80::/64 metric 1024

        lo: unmanaged
            "lo"
            loopback (unknown), 00:00:00:00:00:00, sw, mtu 65536

        DNS configuration:
            servers: 192.168.1.1
            domains: localdomain
            interface: enp0s3

        Use "nmcli device show" to get complete information about known devices and
        "nmcli connection show" to get an overview on active connection profiles.
        ```
        
        Before we even start modifying the connection, you should name this something sane, like the name of the interface (**note** the "\" below escapes the spaces in the name):

        ```
        nmcli connection modify Wired\ connection\ 1 con-name enp0s3
        ```

        Once you've done this, run `nmcli` by itself again and you will see something like this:

        ```bash
        enp0s3: connected to enp0s3
        "Intel 82540EM"
        ethernet (e1000), 08:00:27:E4:2D:3D, hw, mtu 1500
        ip4 default
        inet4 192.168.1.140/24
        route4 192.168.1.0/24 metric 100
        route4 default via 192.168.1.1 metric 100
        ...
        ```
        
        This will make the remaining configuration for the DNS much easier!

    Assuming that your connection profile name is "enp0s3", we will include the already configured DNS but add our local DNS server first:

    ```
    nmcli con mod enp0s3 ipv4.dns '192.168.1.138,192.168.1.1'
    ```

    You can have more DNS servers, and for a machine configured with public DNS servers, say Google's open DNS, you can have something like this instead:

    ```
    nmcli con mod enp0s3 ipv4.dns '192.168.1.138,8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4'
    ```

    Once you've added the DNS servers that you want to the connection, you should be able to resolve hosts in *ourdomain.lan*, as well as Internet hosts.

    ## 9 Firewall Rules - `firewalld`

    !!! note "`firewalld` By Default"

        With Rocky Linux 9.0 and above, using `iptables` rules is deprecated. You should use `firewalld` instead.

    We aren't making any assumptions about the network or services that might be needed, except that we are turning on SSH access and DNS access for our LAN network only. For this, we will use the `firewalld` built-in zone, "trusted". We will also have to make some service changes to the "public" zone in order to limit SSH access to the LAN.

    The first step is to add our LAN network to the "trusted" zone:
    
    ```
    firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-source=192.168.1.0/24 --permanent
    ```

    Next, we need to add our two services to the "trusted" zone:

    ```
    firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-service=ssh --permanent
    firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-service=dns --permanent
    ```

    Finally, we need to remove the SSH service from our "public" zone, which is on by default:

    ```
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-service=ssh --permanent
    ```

    Next, reload the firewall and then list out the zones that we've made changes to:

    ```
    firewall-cmd --reload
    firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --list-all
    ```
    
    Which should show that you have correctly added the services and the source network:

    ```
    trusted (active)
        target: ACCEPT
        icmp-block-inversion: no
        interfaces:
        sources: 192.168.1.0/24
        services: dns ssh
        ports:
        protocols:
        forward: no
        masquerade: no
        forward-ports:
        source-ports:
        icmp-blocks:
        rich rules:
    ```

    Listing out the "public" zone should show that SSH access is no-longer allowed:

    ```
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
    ```

    Which should show you:

    ```
    public
        target: default
        icmp-block-inversion: no
        interfaces:
        sources:
        services: cockpit dhcpv6-client
        ports:
        protocols:
        forward: no
        masquerade: no
        forward-ports:
        source-ports:
        icmp-blocks:
        rich rules:
    ```

    These rules should get you DNS resolution on your private DNS server from hosts on the 192.168.1.0/24 network. In addition, you should be able to SSH from any of those hosts into your private DNS server.

=== "8"

    ## 8 Using IPv4 On Your LAN

    If you are using IPv4 only on your LAN, then you need to make two changes. The first is in `/etc/named.conf` and the second is in `/etc/sysconfig/named`

    First, get back into the `named.conf` file again with `vi /etc/named.conf`. We need to add the following option anywhere in the options section.

    ```
    filter-aaaa-on-v4 yes;
    ```

    This is shown in the image below:

    ![Add Filter IPv6](images/dns_filter.png)

    Once you've made the change, save it and exit the `named.conf` (for _vi_, `SHIFT:wq!`)

    Next we need to make a similar change to `/etc/sysconfig/named`:

    ```
    vi /etc/sysconfig/named
    ```

    And then add this to the bottom of the file:

    ```
    OPTIONS="-4"
    ```

    Now save those changes (again, for _vi_, `SHIFT:wq!`)


    ## 8 Testing Machines

    You need to add the DNS server (in our example 192.168.1.136) to each machine that you want to have access to the servers that you added to your new local DNS. We are only going to show you an example of how to do this on a Rocky Linux workstation, but there are similar methods for other Linux distributions, as well as Windows and Mac machines.

    Keep in mind that you will want to just add the DNS server in the list, as you will still need Internet access, which will require your currently assigned DNS servers. These might be assigned via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) or statically assigned.

    On a Rocky Linux workstation where the enabled network interface is eth0, you would use:

    ```
    vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
    ```

    If your enabled network interface is different, you will need to substitute that interface name. The configuration file that you open will look something like this for a statically assigned IP (not DHCP as mentioned above). In the example below, our machine's IP address is 192.168.1.151:

    ```
    DEVICE=eth0
    BOOTPROTO=none
    IPADDR=192.168.1.151
    PREFIX=24
    GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
    DNS1=8.8.8.8
    DNS2=8.8.4.4
    ONBOOT=yes
    HOSTNAME=tender-kiwi
    TYPE=Ethernet
    MTU=
    ```

    We want to substitute in our new DNS server for the primary (DNS1) and then move each of the other DNS servers down one so that it is like this:

    ```
    DEVICE=eth0
    BOOTPROTO=none
    IPADDR=192.168.1.151
    PREFIX=24
    GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
    DNS1=192.168.1.136
    DNS2=8.8.8.8
    DNS3=8.8.4.4
    ONBOOT=yes
    HOSTNAME=tender-kiwi
    TYPE=Ethernet
    MTU=
    ```

    Once you've made the change, either restart the machine or restart networking with:

    ```
    systemctl restart network
    ```

    Now you should be able to get to anything in the *ourdomain.lan* domain from your workstations, plus still be able to resovle and get to Internet addresses.

    ## 8 Firewall Rules

    ### Adding The Firewall Rules - `iptables`

    !!! note "Regarding `iptables`"

        While `iptables` rules still work in Rocky Linux 8.x, we recommend moving to the `firewalld` rules in the section below. The reason is that in future versions of Rocky Linux, `iptables` will be deprecated and removed. In addition, `firewalld` is the default way of doing things. You will find more examples of using `firewalld` when looking for help, than for using `iptables`. We've included the `iptables` rules here, but for the best results and for future-proofing, we recommend moving to `firewalld` now.

    First, create a file in */etc* called "firewall.conf" that will contain the following rules. This is a bare minimum rule set, and you may need to tweak this for your environment:

    ```
    #!/bin/sh
    #
    #IPTABLES=/usr/sbin/iptables

    #  Unless specified, the defaults for OUTPUT is ACCEPT
    #    The default for FORWARD and INPUT is DROP
    #
    echo "   clearing any existing rules and setting default policy.."
    iptables -F INPUT
    iptables -P INPUT DROP
    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
    # dns rules
    iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m udp -s 192.168.1.0/24 --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
    iptables -A INPUT -p udp -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable

    /usr/sbin/service iptables save
    ```

    Let's evaluate the rules above:

    * The first "iptables" line flushes the rules that are currently loaded (-F).
    * Next, we are setting a default policy for the INPUT chain of DROP. This means, if the traffic is not explicitly allowed here, it is dropped.
    * Next, we have an SSH rule for our local network, so that we can get into the DNS server remotely.
    * Then we have our DNS allow rule, only for our local network. Note that DNS uses the UDP protocol (User Datagram Protocol).
    * Next we allow INPUT from the local interface.
    * Then if you have established a connection for something else, we are allowing related packets in as well.
    * And finally we reject everything else.
    * The last line tells iptables to save the rules so that when the machine restarts, the rules will load as well.

    Once our firewall.conf file is created, we need to make it executable:

    ```
    chmod +x /etc/firewall.conf
    ```

    Then run it:

    ```
    /etc/firewall.conf
    ```

    And this is what you should get in return. If you get something else, take a look at your script for errors:

    ```bash
    clearing any existing rules and setting default policy..
    iptables: Saving firewall rules to /etc/sysconfig/iptables:[  OK  ]
    ```

    ### Adding The Firewall Rules - `firewalld`

    With `firewalld`, we are duplicating the rules highlighted in `iptables` above. We aren't making any other assumptions about the network or services that might be needed. We are turning on SSH access and DNS access for our LAN network only. For this, we will use the `firewalld` built-in zone, "trusted". We will also have to make some service changes to the "public" zone in order to limit SSH access to the LAN.

    The first step is to add our LAN network to the "trusted" zone:

    ```
    firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-source=192.168.1.0/24 --permanent
    ```

    Next, we need to add our two services to the "trusted" zone:

    ```
    firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-service=ssh --permanent
    firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-service=dns --permanent
    ```

    Finally, we need to remove the SSH service from our "public" zone, which is on by default:

    ```
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-service=ssh --permanent
    ```

    Next, reload the firewall and then list out the zones that we've made changes to:

    ```
    firewall-cmd --reload
    firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --list-all
    ```

    Which should show that you have correctly added the services and the source network:

    ```bash
    trusted (active)
        target: ACCEPT
        icmp-block-inversion: no
        interfaces:
        sources: 192.168.1.0/24
        services: dns ssh
        ports:
        protocols:
        forward: no
        masquerade: no
        forward-ports:
        source-ports:
        icmp-blocks:
        rich rules:
    ```

    Listing out the "public" zone should show that SSH access is no-longer allowed:

    ```
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
    ```

    ```bash
    public
        target: default
        icmp-block-inversion: no
        interfaces:
        sources:
        services: cockpit dhcpv6-client
        ports:
        protocols:
        forward: no
        masquerade: no
        forward-ports:
        source-ports:
        icmp-blocks:
        rich rules:
    ```

    These rules should get you DNS resolution on your private DNS server from hosts on the 192.168.1.0/24 network. In addition, you should be able to SSH from any of those hosts into your private DNS server.

## Conclusions

While using */etc/hosts* on an individual workstation will get you access to a machine on your internal network, you can only use it on that one machine. By adding a private DNS server using _bind_, you can add hosts to the DNS and as long as the workstations have access to that private DNS server, they will be able to get to these local servers.

If you don't need machines to resolve on the Internet, but do need local access from several machines to local servers, then consider using a private DNS server instead.
