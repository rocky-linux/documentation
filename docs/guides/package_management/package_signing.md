# Package signing and testing'


RPMs produced by us should be cryptographically signed with a Rocky Linux key, which guarantees to users that the package was
indeed built by the Rocky Linux project.

The package will also need to be put through some testing - preferably automated. The nature of the testing is yet to be determined,
but weâ€™ll want to do some sanity checks at the bare minimum before unleashing it on the world. (Is this package installable? Did we accidentally miss any files? Does it cause dnf/yum dependency conflicts? etc.)
