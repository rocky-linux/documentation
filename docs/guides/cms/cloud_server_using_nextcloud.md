## Prerequisites and assumptions

- Server running Rocky Linux (you can install Nextcloud on any Linux distribution, but this procedure assumes you are using Rocky).
- A high degree of comfort operating from the command line for installation and for configuration.
- Knowledge of a command-line editor. Using `vi` for this example, but you can use your favorite editor if you have one.
- This procedure covers the `.zip` file installation method. You can also install Nextcloud with a snap application.
- This procedure uses the Apache _sites enabled_ document (linked later) for directory setup.
- This procedure also uses _mariadb-server_ hardening (also linked later) for database setup.
- Throughout this document the assumption is that you are root, or that you can elevate privileges with `sudo`.
- The example domain in use here is "yourdomain.com".

## Introduction

If you are in charge of a server environment for a large (or even a small) company, you might consider using cloud applications. Doing things in the cloud can free up your own resources for other things, but there is a downside to this, and that is the loss of control of your company's data. If a compromise occurs in the cloud application, you could risk your company's data too.

Taking the cloud back into your own environment is a way to reclaim security of your data at the expense of your time and energy. Sometimes, this is a cost worth paying.

Nextcloud offers an open source cloud with security and flexibility in mind. Note that building a Nextcloud server is a good exercise, even if you opt to take your cloud off-site in the end. The following procedure deals with setting up Nextcloud on Rocky Linux.

## Nextcloud install

### Installing and configuring repositories and modules

For this installation, you need two repositories. You need to install the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux), and the Remi Repository for 10.

!!! note

    While Rocky Linux 10 contains the minimum required PHP version of 8.3, the Remi repository contains other PHP packages necessary for Nextcloud.

To install the EPEL run:

```bash
dnf install epel-release
```

To install the Remi repository run:

```bash
dnf install https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-10.rpm
```

Then run `dnf upgrade` again.

Run the following to see a list of available PHP modules:

```bash
dnf module list php
```

This gives you this output for Rocky Linux 10:

```bash
Remi's Modular repository for Enterprise Linux 10 - x86_64
Name                   Stream                      Profiles                                      Summary                                  
php                    remi-7.4                    common [d], devel, minimal                    PHP scripting language                   
php                    remi-8.0                    common [d], devel, minimal                    PHP scripting language                   
php                    remi-8.1                    common [d], devel, minimal                    PHP scripting language                   
php                    remi-8.2                    common [d], devel, minimal                    PHP scripting language                   
php                    remi-8.3                    common [d], devel, minimal                    PHP scripting language                   
php                    remi-8.4                    common [d], devel, minimal                    PHP scripting language

Hint: [d]efault, [e]nabled, [x]disabled, [i]nstalled
```

Use the newest PHP that Nextcloud is compatible with. At this moment this is 8.4. Enable that module with:

```bash
dnf module enable php:remi-8.4
```

To see how this changes the output of the module list, run the module list command again and you will see the "[e]" next to 8.3:

```bash
dnf module list php
```

The output is the same except for this line:

```bash
php                    remi-8.4 [e]                   common [d], devel, minimal                  PHP scripting language
```

### Installing packages

The example here uses Apache and mariadb. To install the needed packages, do the following:

```bash
dnf install httpd mariadb-server vim wget zip unzip libxml2 openssl php84-php php84-php-ctype php84-php-curl php84-php-gd php84-php-iconv php84-php-json php84-php-libxml php84-php-mbstring php84-php-openssl php84-php-posix php84-php-session php84-php-xml php84-php-zip php84-php-zlib php84-php-pdo php84-php-mysqlnd php84-php-intl php84-php-bcmath php84-php-gmp
```

### Configuring

#### Configuring Apache

Set _apache_ to start on boot:

```bash
systemctl enable httpd
```

Then start it:

```bash
systemctl start httpd
```

#### Create the configuration

In the _Prerequisites and Assumptions_ section, there was a statement that you will be using the [Apache Sites Enabled](../web/apache-sites-enabled.md) procedure for your configuration. Click over to that procedure and set up the basics there, and then return to this document to continue.

For Nextcloud, you will need to create the following configuration file:

```bash
vi /etc/httpd/sites-available/com.yourdomain.nextcloud
```

With the content:

```bash
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/sub-domains/com.yourdomain.nextcloud/html/
  ServerName  nextcloud.yourdomain.com
  <Directory /var/www/sub-domains/com.yourdomain.nextcloud/html/>
    Require all granted
    AllowOverride All
    Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    <IfModule mod_dav.c>
      Dav off
    </IfModule>
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Once done, save your changes (with ++shift+colon+"w"+"q"+exclam++ for _vi_).

Next, create a link to this file in `/etc/httpd/sites-enabled`:

```bash
ln -s /etc/httpd/sites-available/com.yourdomain.nextcloud /etc/httpd/sites-enabled/
```

#### Creating the directory

As noted in the configuration earlier, you need to create the _DocumentRoot_. Do this with:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/sub-domains/com.yourdomain.com/html
```

This is where you will install your Nextcloud instance.

#### Configuring PHP

You need to set the time zone for PHP. To do this, open up `php.ini` with your text editor of choice:

```bash
vi /etc/opt/remi/php84/php.ini
```

Then find the line:

```php
;date.timezone =
```

Remove the remark (++semicolon++) and set our time zone. For this example time zone, you can put in either:

```php
date.timezone = "America/Chicago"
```

OR

```php
date.timezone = "US/Central"
```

Then save and exit the `php.ini` file.

Note that for the sake of keeping things the same, your time zone in the `php.ini` file should match up to your machine's time zone setting. You can discover what this is by doing the following:

```bash
ls -al /etc/localtime
```

You should see something such as this, assuming you set your time zone when you installed Rocky Linux and are living in the Central time zone:

```bash
/etc/localtime -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago
```

#### Configuring mariadb-server

Set `mariadb-server` to start on boot:

```bash
systemctl enable mariadb
```

And then start it:

```bash
systemctl restart mariadb
```

Again, as indicated earlier, use the setup procedure for [hardening `mariadb-server`](../database/database_mariadb-server.md) for the initial configuration.

### Installing .zip

The next few steps assume that you are remotely connected to your Nextcloud server via `ssh` with a remote console open:

- Navigate to the [Nextcloud website](https://nextcloud.com/).
- Let your mouse hover over 'Download' which will open a drop-down menu.
- Click 'Nextcloud server'.
- Click 'Download server archive'.
- Right-click 'Get ZIP file' and copy the link.
- In your remote console on the Nextcloud server, type `wget` and then a space and paste in what you just copied. You should get something similar to the following: `wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/latest.zip`.
- Once you hit enter, the download of the .zip file will start and complete quickly.

Once the download is complete, extract the Nextcloud .zip file with:

```bash
unzip latest.zip
```

### Copying content and changing permissions

After completing the .zip file extraction step, you should now have a new directory in `/root` called "nextcloud." Change into this directory:

```bash
cd nextcloud
```

Either copy or move the content to our _DocumentRoot_:

```bash
cp -Rf * /var/www/sub-domains/com.yourdomain.nextcloud/html/
```

OR

```bash
mv * /var/www/sub-domains/com.yourdomain.nextcloud/html/
```

The next step is to make sure that apache owns the directory. Do this with:

```bash
chown -Rf apache.apache /var/www/sub-domains/com.yourdomain.nextcloud/html
```

For security reasons, you also want to move the _data_ folder from inside to outside of the _DocumentRoot_. Do this with the following command:

```bash
mv /var/www/sub-domains/com.yourdomain.nextcloud/html/data /var/www/sub-domains/com.yourdomain.nextcloud/
```

### Configuring Nextcloud

Ensure that you have your services running. If you followed the earlier steps, they should already be running. You have had several steps between those initial service starts, so restart them just to be sure:

```bash
systemctl restart httpd
systemctl restart mariadb
```

If everything restarts and there are no issues, then you are ready to move on.

To do the initial configuration, you want to load the site in a web browser:

<http://your-server-hostname/> (replace with your actual hostname)

Assuming that you have done everything correctly so far, you should see a Nextcloud setup screen:

![nextcloud login screen](../images/nextcloud_screen.jpg)

There are a couple of things that you want to do differently than the defaults:

- At the top of the web page, where it says `Create an admin account`, set the user and password. For the sake of this example, enter `admin` and setting a strong password. Remember to save this somewhere safe (such as a password manager) so that you do not lose it. Even though you have typed into this field, ==do not hit== ++enter++ until you complete **all** the fields.
- Under the `Storage & database` section, change the `Data folder` location from the default document root, to where you moved the data folder earlier: `/var/www/sub-domains/com.yourdomain.nextcloud/data`.
- Under the `Configure the database` section, change from `SQLite` to `MySQL/MariaDB` by clicking on that button.
- Type the MariaDB root user and password that you set earlier into the `Database user` and `Database password` fields.
- In the `Database name` field, type `nextcloud`.
- In the `localhost` field, type <localhost:3306> (3306 is the default _mariadb_ connect port).

Once you have all this, click `Finish Setup` and you should be up and running.

The browser window will refresh for a bit and then usually not reload the site. Enter your URL in the browser window again and you should see the default first pages.

Your administrative user is already (or should be) logged in at this point, and there are several informational pages designed to get you up to speed. The "Dashboard" is what users will see when they first login. The administrative user can now create other users, install other applications, and many other tasks.

The "Nextcloud Manual.pdf" file is the user manual, so that users can get familiar with what is available. The administrative user should read through or at least scan the high points of the admin manual [On the Nextcloud website](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/21/admin_manual/)

## Next steps

At this point, do not forget that this is a server that you will be storing company data on. It is important to get it locked down with a firewall, get the [backup set up](../backup/rsnapshot_backup.md), secure the site with an [SSL](../security/generating_ssl_keys_lets_encrypt.md), and any other needed tasks to keep your data safe.

## Conclusions

You need to evaluate carefully any decision to take the company cloud in house. For those that decide that keeping company data locally is preferable over an external cloud host, Nextcloud is a good alternative.
