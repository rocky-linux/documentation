## Introduction

[Chyrp Lite](https://chyrplite.net/) is an ultra-lightweight blogging engine written in PHP.

## Prerequisites and assumptions

The following are minimum requirements for using this procedure:

* The ability to run commands as the root user or use `sudo` to elevate privileges
* Familiarity with a command-line editor. The author is using `vi` or `vim` here, but substitute in your favorite editor

## Installing Caddy

We will use Caddy as the web server. To install Caddy, you need to first install the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) and run updates:

```bash
dnf -y install epel-release && dnf -y update
```

Then install Caddy:

```bash
dnf -y install Caddy
```

Subsequently, open the `Caddyfile`:

```bash
vi /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

Add the following to your `Caddyfile`:

```bash
your.domain.name {
        root * /var/www/chyrp-lite
        file_server
        php_fastcgi 127.0.0.1:9000
}
```

Save the file with `:wq!` and then open the corresponding firewall ports:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Finally, start Caddy:

```bash
systemctl enable --now caddy
```

## Installing PHP

!!! note

    If you are running Rocky Linux 8.x, substitute 8 next to the release in the remi package install line. 

To install PHP, you will need the Remi repository. To install the Remi repository run:

```bash
dnf install https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-9.rpm
```

Then install PHP and the required modules:

```bash
dnf install -y php83-php php83-php-session php83-php-json php83-php-ctype php83-php-filter php83-php-libxml php83-php-simplexml php83-php-mbstring php83-php-pdo php83-php-curl
```

Next, open the PHP configuration file:

```bash
vi /etc/opt/remi/php83/php-fpm.d/www.conf
```

Go down to the `listen =` line and set it to the following:

```bash
listen = 127.0.0.1:9000
```

Exit `vi` with `:wq!` and enable PHP:

```bash
systemctl enable --now php83-php-fpm.service
```

## Installing Chyrp

Now we are going to install Chyrp Lite. To do so, download the latest release:

```bash
cd /var/www
wget https://github.com/xenocrat/chyrp-lite/archive/refs/tags/v2024.03.zip
```

Next, decompress and move the extracted folder:

```bash
unzip v2024.03.zip
mv chyrp-lite-2024.03/ chyrp-lite
```

Set the correct permissions on the `chyrp-lite` folder:

```bash
chown -R apache:apache chyrp-lite/
```

Set up a data directory for storing the SQLite database:

```bash
mkdir chyrp-lite-data
chown -R apache:apache chyrp-lite-data/
```

Next set up the SELinux file contexts:

```bash
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t "/var/www/chyrp-lite(/.*)?"
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t "/var/www/chyrp-lite-data(/.*)?"
restorecon -Rv /var/www/chyrp-lite
restorecon -Rv /var/www/chyrp-lite-data
```

On a client machine, open up a web browser to `https://your.domain.name/install.php` and run the installation program (replace `your.domain.name` with your actual domain name or hostname):

![Chyrp Lite Setup](../images/chyrp_lite_setup.png)

In the **Database** section, select a pathname in the `chyrp-lite-data` directory made earlier, such as `/var/www/chyrp-lite-data/sqlite.db`.

Then complete the other fields, which should be self-explanatory.

Next click **Install me** and then **Take me to my site**. You should now be able to visit a completed installation of your Chyrp site:

## Conclusion

Considering that WordPress has evolved into a Swiss army knife of web development, it is not surprising some webmasters (the author included) would prefer a lightweight blogging engine. Chyrp Lite is perfect in for those users.
