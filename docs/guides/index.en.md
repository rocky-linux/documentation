# Rocky Linux guides

Welcome to the **Guides** section of the Rocky Linux documentation. You will find many "how-to" documents and more here. These documents are changing all the time. Longer document groups are in **Books**, educational instructions are in **Labs**, while smaller bits of code shared by users are in **Gemstones** in the top menus.

Most of the categories do not require any explanation. If you want to find out how to help in the ongoing development of Rocky Linux, join the [Mattermost Development channel](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/development). For those wishing to help with documentation, join the [Mattermost Documentation channel](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation) and share in the discussion.

If you are wanting to jump right in, you can [install Rocky Linux](installation.md) now!
