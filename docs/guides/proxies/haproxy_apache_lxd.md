# HAProxy load balancing Apache with LXD containers

## Introduction

HAProxy stands for "High Availability Proxy." This proxy can sit before any TCP application (such as web servers), but it is often used as a load balancer between many website instances.


There might be many reasons for doing this. If you have a website that is being hit hard — adding another instance of that same website and placing HAProxy in front of both — allows you to distribute traffic between instances. Another reason might be to be able to update content on a website without any down time. HAProxy can also help mitigate DOS and DDOS attacks.

This guide will explore using HAProxy with two website instances, and load balancing with round-robin rotation on the same LXD host. This might be a perfectly fine solution for ensuring that updates can be performed without downtime.

However, if your problem is website performance, you may need to distribute your multiple sites across actual bare metal or multiple LXD hosts. It is certainly possible to do all of this on bare metal without using LXD. However, LXD offers great flexibility and performance, and is also excellent for lab testing.

## Prerequisites and assumptions

* Complete comfort at the command line on a Linux machine
* Experience with a command line editor (using `vim` here)
* Experience with `crontab`
* Knowledge of LXD. For more information, you may want to consult the [LXD Server](../../books/lxd_server/00-toc.md) document. It is fine to install LXD on a notebook or workstation without doing the full-blown server install. This document is written with a lab machine running LXD, but is not set up as an entire server as the document linked above uses.
* Some knowledge of installing, configuring, and using web servers.
* We will assume that LXD is already installed and ready to create containers.

## Installing containers

On your LXD host for this guide, you will need three containers. There can be more web server containers if you want. You will use **web1** and **web2** for our website containers and **proxyha** for our HAProxy container. To install these on your LXD host do:

```
lxc launch images:rockylinux/8 web1
lxc launch images:rockylinux/8 web2
lxc launch images:rockylinux/8 proxyha
```
Running an `lxc list` should return something like this:

```
+---------+---------+----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
|  NAME   |  STATE  |         IPV4         | IPV6 |   TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |
+---------+---------+----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
| proxyha | RUNNING | 10.181.87.137 (eth0) |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
+---------+---------+----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
| web1    | RUNNING | 10.181.87.207 (eth0) |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
+---------+---------+----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
| web2    | RUNNING | 10.181.87.34 (eth0)  |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
+---------+---------+----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
```

## Creating and using the `macvlan` profile

The containers run on the default bridge interface with bridge-assigned DHCP addresses. These need to change to DHCP addresses from our local LAN. The first thing needed is to create and assign the `macvlan` profile.

Start by creating the profile:

`lxc profile create macvlan`

Ensure that your editor is set to your preferred editor, in this case `vim`:

`export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim`

Next, change the `macvlan` profile. Before you do, you need to know what interface the host uses for our LAN. Run `ip addr` and look for the interface with the LAN IP assignment:

```
2: eno1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether a8:5e:45:52:f8:b6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.141/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eno1
```
!!! Note

    In this case, the interface you are looking for is "eno1", which could be completely different on your system. Use **your** interface information!

Now that you know the LAN interface, you can change our `macvlan` profile. To do this, at the command line enter:

`lxc profile edit macvlan`

Edit the profile to look something like this. The author excluded the comments at the top of the file, but if you are new to LXD, examine those:

```
config: {}
description: ""
devices:
  eth0:
    name: eth0
    nictype: macvlan
    parent: eno1
    type: nic
name: macvlan
```

When creating the `macvlan` profile, the system copies the `default` profile. Changing the `default` profile is impossible.

Now that the `macvlan` profile exists, you need to apply it to our three containers:

```
lxc profile assign web1 default,macvlan
lxc profile assign web2 default,macvlan
lxc profile assign proxyha default,macvlan
```

Unfortunately, the default behavior of `macvlan` as implemented in the kernel, is inexplicably broken within an LXD container (see [this document](../../books/lxd_server/06-profiles.md)) `dhclient` on boot in each of the containers.

Doing this is pretty simplistic when using DHCP. Just follow this for each container:

* `lxc exec web1 bash` which will put you at the command line of the **web1** container
* `crontab -e` which will edit root's `crontab` on the container
* type `i` to get into insert mode.
* add a line: `@reboot /usr/sbin/dhclient`
* hit the `ESC` key to exit out of insert mode.
* save your changes with `SHIFT: wq`
* type `exit` to exit the container

Repeat steps for **web2** and **proxyha**.

After completing these steps, restart the containers:

```
lxc restart web1
lxc restart web2
lxc restart proxyha
```

and when you do an `lxc list` again, you will see that the DHCP addresses are now assigned from your LAN:

```
+---------+---------+----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
|  NAME   |  STATE  |         IPV4         | IPV6 |   TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |
+---------+---------+----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
| proxyha | RUNNING | 192.168.1.149 (eth0) |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
+---------+---------+----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
| web1    | RUNNING | 192.168.1.150 (eth0) |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
+---------+---------+----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
| web2    | RUNNING | 192.168.1.101 (eth0) |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
+---------+---------+----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
```

## Installing Apache and changing the welcome screen

Our environment is ready. Next, install Apache (`httpd`) on each web container. You can do this without physically accessing them:

```
lxc exec web1 dnf install httpd
lxc exec web2 dnf install httpd
```
You will need more than Apache for any modern web server, but this is enough to run some tests.

Next, enable `httpd`, start it, and change the default welcome screen. This way, you know the server is responding when attempting to access by proxy.

Enable and start `httpd`:

```
lxc exec web1 systemctl enable httpd
lxc exec web1 systemctl start httpd
lxc exec web2 systemctl enable httpd
lxc exec web2 systemctl start httpd
```

Change the welcome screen. This screen comes up when no website configured, essentially a default page that loads. In Rocky Linux, this page is here `/usr/share/httpd/noindex/index.html`. Changing that file requires no direct access to the container. Just do the following:

`lxc exec web1 vi /usr/share/httpd/noindex/index.html`

search for the `<h1>` tag, which will show this:

`<h1>HTTP Server <strong>Test Page</strong></h1>`

Change that line to read:

`<h1>SITE1 HTTP Server <strong>Test Page</strong></h1>`

Repeat the process for web2. Going to these machines by IP in a browser will now return the correct welcome page for each. There is more to do with the web servers, but leave them and go to the proxy server for now.

## Installing HAProxy on proxyha and LXD proxy configuration

It is simplistic to install HAProxy on the proxy container. Again, no need to access that container directly:

`lxc exec proxyha dnf install haproxy`

Next you want to configure `haproxy` to listen on port 80 and port 443 for the web services. Do this with the configure subcommand of `lxc`:
```
lxc config device add proxyha http proxy listen=tcp:0.0.0.0:80 connect=tcp:127.0.0.1:80
lxc config device add proxyha https proxy listen=tcp:0.0.0.0:443 connect=tcp:127.0.0.1:443
```

For our testing, you are only going to use port 80, or HTTP traffic, but this shows you how you configure the container to listen on the default web ports for HTTP and HTTPS. Using this command also ensures that restarting the **proxyha** container will maintain those listening ports.

## The HAProxy configuration

You have already installed HAProxy on the container, but you have done nothing with the configuration. Before configuring, you need to do something to resolve your hosts. Normally you would use fully qualified domain names, but in this lab environment, you use IPs. To get some names associated with the machines, you are going to add some host file records to the **proxyha** container.

`lxc exec proxyha vi /etc/hosts`

Add the following records to the bottom of the file:

```
192.168.1.150   site1.testdomain.com     site1
192.168.1.101   site2.testdomain.com     site2
```

Which allows the **proxyha** container to resolve those names.

Edit the `haproxy.cfg` file. You are not using much of the original file. You need to make a backup of the file first by moving it to a different name:

`lxc exec proxyha mv /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.orig`

Create a new configuration file:

`lxc exec proxyha vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`

Note, the commenting out of HTTPS protocol lines for now. In a production environment, you will want to use a wildcard certificate that covers your web servers and enable HTTPS:

```

log /dev/log local0
log /dev/log local1 notice
chroot /var/lib/haproxy

backend subdomain2
# balance leastconn
  balance roundrobin
  http-request set-header X-Client-IP %[src]
# redirect scheme https if !{ ssl_fc }
     server site2 site2.testdomain.com:80 check
     server site1 site1.testdomain.com:80 check
```

A little explanation of what is going on above. You should see this in your testing, when you get to the testing section of this guide (below):

Definitions for **site1** and **site2** are in the "acl" section. Each site is in each other's round-robins for their respective back ends. What happens when you go to site1.testdomain.com in the test, the URL does not change, but the page inside will switch each time you access the page from the **site1** to the **site2** test pages. Same goes for site2.testdomain.com.

Doing this shows you the switch is occurring, but in reality, your website content will look exactly the same regardless of which server you are hitting. Note the document is showing how you might want to distribute traffic between multiple hosts. You can also use "leastcon" in the balance line, and instead of switching based on the previous hit, it will load the site with the least number of connections.

### The error files

Some versions of HAProxy come with a standard set of web error files, however the version that comes from Rocky Linux (and the upstream vendor), does not have these files. You probably **do** want to create them, as they may help you troubleshoot any problems. These files go in the directory `/etc/haproxy/errors` which does not exist.

First, create that directory:

`lxc exec proxyha mkdir /etc/haproxy/errors`

Create each of these files in that directory. Note that you can do this with each filename from your LXD host with the command `lxc exec proxyha vi /etc/haproxy/errors/filename.http`, where "filename.http" references one of the file names below. In a production environment, your company may have more specific errors that they want to use:

File name `400.http`:

```
HTTP/1.0 400 Bad request
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<html><body><h1>400 Bad request</h1>

</body></html>
```

File name `403.http`:

```
HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<html><body><h1>403 Forbidden</h1>
Request forbidden by administrative rules.
</body></html>
```

Filename `408.http`:

```

Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<html><body><h1>408 Request Time-out</h1>
Your browser didn't send a complete request in time.
</body></html>
```

Filename `500.http`:

```
HTTP/1.0 500 Internal Server Error
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<html><body><h1>500 Internal Server Error</h1>

</body></html>
```

Filename `502.http`:

```

Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<html><body><h1>502 Bad Gateway</h1>

</body></html>
```

Filename `503.http`:

```

Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<html><body><h1>503 Service Unavailable</h1>

</body></html>
```

Filename `504.http`:

```

Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<html><body><h1>504 Gateway Time-out</h1>

</body></html>
```

## Running the proxy

Create a "run" directory for `haproxy` before starting the service:

`lxc exec proxyha mkdir /run/haproxy`

Next, enable the service and start it:
```
lxc exec proxyha systemctl enable haproxy
lxc exec proxyha systemctl start haproxy
```
If you get any errors, research the reason by using:

`lxc exec proxyha systemctl status haproxy`

If everything starts and runs without issue, you are ready to move on to testing.

## Testing the proxy

As with the hosts (`/etc/hosts`) setup used so that our **proxyha** container can resolve the web servers, and since our lab environment does not have a local DNS server running, set the IP values on our local machine for each the websites, to correspond to our haproxy container.

To do this, change your `/etc/hosts` file on your local machine. Consider this method of domain resolution a "poor man's DNS."

`sudo vi /etc/hosts`

Add these two lines:

```
192.168.1.149   site1.testdomain.com     site1
192.168.1.149   site2.testdomain.com     site2
```

If you ping either **site1** or **site2** on your local machine now, you will get a response from **proxyha**:

```
PING site1.testdomain.com (192.168.1.149) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from site1.testdomain.com (192.168.1.149): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.427 ms
64 bytes from site1.testdomain.com (192.168.1.149): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.430 ms
```

Open your web browser and type site1.testdomain.com (or site2.testdomain.com) as the URL in the address bar. You will get a response back from one of the two test pages and if you load the page again, you will get the next server's test page. Note that the URL does not change, but the returned page will change alternately between servers.

## Logging

Even though our configuration file is set up correctly for logging, you need two things: First, a directory in /var/lib/haproxy/ called "dev":

`lxc exec proxyha mkdir /var/lib/haproxy/dev`

Next, create a system process for `rsyslogd` to grab instances from the socket (`/var/lib/haproxy/dev/log` in this case) and store those in `/var/log/haproxy.log`:

`lxc exec proxyha vi /etc/rsyslog.d/99-haproxy.conf`

Add the following contents to that file:

```
$AddUnixListenSocket /var/lib/haproxy/dev/log

# Send HAProxy messages to a dedicated logfile
:programname, startswith, "haproxy" {
  /var/log/haproxy.log
  stop
}
```
Save the file and exit, and restart `rsyslog`:

`lxc exec proxyha systemctl restart rsyslog`

To populate that log file with something right away, restart `haproxy` again:

`lxc exec proxyha systemctl restart haproxy`

View the log file created:

`lxc exec proxyha more /var/log/haproxy.log`

Which will show you something like this:

```
Sep 25 23:18:02 proxyha haproxy[4602]: Proxy http_frontend started.
Sep 25 23:18:02 proxyha haproxy[4602]: Proxy http_frontend started.
Sep 25 23:18:02 proxyha haproxy[4602]: Proxy subdomain1 started.
Sep 25 23:18:02 proxyha haproxy[4602]: Proxy subdomain1 started.
Sep 25 23:18:02 proxyha haproxy[4602]: Proxy subdomain2 started.
Sep 25 23:18:02 proxyha haproxy[4602]: Proxy subdomain2 started.
```

## Conclusions

HAProxy is a powerful proxy engine used for many things. It is a high-performance, open source load balancer and reverse proxy for TCP and HTTP applications. This document demonstrated how to use load balancing of two web server instances.

Using it for other applications, including databases, is also possible. It works within LXD containers, and on standalone servers.

There are plenty of uses not covered in this document. Check out the [official manual for HAProxy here.](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.8/configuration.html)
