## Introduction

Rocky Summer of Docs (RSOD) is a program that began in the summer of 2024. Based on Google's Summer of Code, RSOD challenges new and existing documentation contributors to add documentation based on particular Documentation team goals. The hope is to offer this program annually.

If you have suggestions for future RSOD projects, we would love to hear your suggestions. You can reach us on [Documentation Team Mattermost channel](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation).
