## Introduction

In the early Fall of 2025, the documentation team moved from a single version of documentation covering all versions, to each version having its own documentation branch. This makes it easier to differentiate between instructions from one version to the next. It *does*, however, complicate the process of writing or fixing documentation, particularly if it is for one of the older (Rocky Linux 8 or 9) versions. This document outlines a strategy for dealing with the process by using a double-remote approach.

!!! info "Rocky Linux Versions"

    As of this date, October 2025, the versions are as follows:

    | Branch | Version |
    |--------|---------|
    | main   | Rocky Linux 10 |
    | rocky-9 | Rocky Linux 9 |
    | rocky-8 | Rocky Linux 8 |

## Prerequisites

* A personal GitHub account with [SSH keys already in use](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
* An existing fork of the Rocky Linux documentation
* A little knowledge about the use of `git` at the command line or a willingness to learn
* Have the `git` utility installed

## Cloning the repository

Cloning the Rocky Linux repository moves a copy of the Rocky Linux documentation into your workstation in a `/documentation` directory. You might have read at some point, or on other GitHub projects, to always clone from your personal fork of the project. In this case, in order for your clone to be version aware, this is not the case. You want to clone from the Rocky Linux project. This document will tell you why that is the case as it goes. In addition, you will need to rename your git remotes so that they make logical sense (Rocky Linux "upstream" and your GitHub "origin").

1. Clone the Rocky Linux documentation:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:rocky-linux/documentation.git
    ```

2. Change into the `/documentation` directory:

    ```bash
    cd documentation
    ```

3. Check the remote name:

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

    This will show:

    ```bash
    origin git@github.com:rocky-linux/documentation.git (fetch)
    origin git@github.com:rocky-linux/documentation.git (push)
    ```

    You want this resource to be "upstream" rather than "origin".

4. Change the remote name

    ```bash
    git remote rename origin upstream
    ```

    Running the `git remote -v` again will now show:

    ```bash
    upstream git@github.com:rocky-linux/documentation.git (fetch)
    upstream git@github.com:rocky-linux/documentation.git (push)

    ```

## Adding your fork as a remote

With the Rocky Linux remote now added and properly named, you need to add your own personal GitHub fork as the origin remote.

1. For this step, you will need to know your GitHub user name, which you should already know. Replace the "[username]" field with the correct name. Add your remote:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin git@github.com:[username]/documentation.git
    ```

2. Check your git remotes:

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

    This will show:

    ```bash
    origin git@github.com:[username]/documentation.git (fetch)
    origin git@github.com:[username]/documentation.git (push)
    upstream git@github.com:rocky-linux/documentation.git (fetch)
    upstream git@github.com:rocky-linux/documentation.git (push)
    ```

## Checking for updates and adding the version branches to your fork

1. With the remotes added, start by pulling any updates from upstream and pushing them to origin. If you have just created your fork and your remotes, then there will be no updates to push, but it is a good idea to start with this:

    ```bash
    git pull upstream main && git push origin main
    ```

2. Check out one of the two older version branches:

    ```bash
    git checkout rocky-8
    ```

    !!! warning "This does not work if your clone was from your fork"

        This is why the cloning process is done from Rocky Linux instead of from your fork. Your fork will not be aware of the older branches. In order to get the message that follows, you *must* clone your local documentation repository from Rocky Linux. 

    If you have set up your remotes correctly, you should now see:

    ```bash
    branch 'rocky-8' set up to track 'upstream/rocky-8'.
    Switched to a new branch 'rocky-8'
    ```

    This effectively creates a local branch `rocky-8`. Your next step is to pull any changes from 'rocky-8' and push them to your origin. There should not be any changes locally, but the branch does not exist on your fork, so this process will create it:

    ```bash
    git pull upstream rocky-8 && git push origin rocky-8
    ```

    You will probably get some sort of a message that you can create a pull request from the push. You can ignore this. What has happened is that your fork now has a `rocky-8` branch.

3. Check out the remaining older branch. (`rocky-9`) and repeat the steps you just ran with that branch.

Once completed, you will now have `main`, `rocky-8` and `rocky-9` branches on your local fork and clone, and will be able to write documentation on any of those branches.

## Writing a document or updating an existing document on an older version

If you are familiar with writing a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch of the documentation, this process still works as it always has. Just remember that `main` is for the newest version (10 at the time of this writing). To make a small change to one of the older versions, you first need to create a branch for editing locally based on that branch. To do that, use the `-b` option with your `git checkout` command. This command, creates a branch called `8_rkhunter_changes` and bases it on the `rocky-8` branch:

```bash
git checkout -b 8_rkhunter_changes rocky-8
```

You can now edit the file you want to make changes to and it will use the version of that document that exists in the `rocky-8` branch.

Once completed editing, save, stage, and commit your changes as normal, and then push your changes to your `origin` remote:

```bash
git push origin 8_rkhunter_changes
```

When you create the PR, though, GitHub will automatically think you are creating a PR to change the `main` branch, even though you specifically used the `rocky-8` branch when modifying the document. Take care not to create the PR to quickly when you see this wrong comparison screen:

![Wrong comparison](../images/incorrect_comparison_branchb_blur.png)

What you need to do here, is change the comparison branch to the correct (`rocky-8` in this case) branch:

![Right comparison](../images/correct_comparison_branch_blur.png)

After correcting the comparison branch, continue creating the PR and then wait for the merge of your PR.

## Updating your older version branches after a merge

Just as with the `main` branch, it is a good idea to keep your older version branches current with any changes. The following set of commands will update *all* of your versions so that they match the upstream:

```bash
git checkout rocky-8
git pull upstream rocky-8 && git push origin rocky-8
git checkout rocky-9
git pull upstream rocky-9 && git push origin rocky-9
git checkout main
git pull upstream main && git push origin main
```

After completing these commands, all of your local branches and your fork, will be current.

## Conclusion

This document walks you through a double-remote strategy for dealing with new documents or corrections since the creation of document versions.
