# Rocky Linux Summer of Docs 2024

## Project: Desktop User Documentation Enhancement

Our first Rocky Linux (RL) Summer of Docs initiative aims to create a new documentation category for Enterprise Linux Desktop Users. 

Inspired by the highly esteemed and eponymous Google Season of Docs project, this project aims to fill a gap in the current RL documentation.

By developing comprehensive, user-friendly, and multilingual desktop user guides, we can expand RL's user base and improve its usability. This will make Rocky Linux more appealing to a wider audience and strengthen its position in the enterprise Linux market.

## Scope

- Develop a framework and template for contributing desktop-focused documentation.
- Create user-friendly guides for desktop users.
- Craft guides tailored for both general and accessibility-focused use.
- Translate documentation into multiple languages.

## Timeline

- **June 15 - June 30**: Initial assessment, sprint planning, participant selection, onboarding, topic selection, and set up for virtual desktop environment.
- **July 1 - August 30**: Content creation and translations.
- **Sept 1 - Sept 15**: Revisions based on community feedback and final translations.

## Application Process
This project is open to everyone. Interested candidates should email docs@rockylinux.org with any of the following:

- Portfolios or other open-source contributions
- Proposed topics/titles for RL desktop documentation
- Preferred languages for translation

## Grant

- Contribute 5 original desktop-focused guides to the new "Desktop" category and receive $200 (up to $1000).
- Review and translate 4 desktop-focused guides and receive $100 (up to $500).

The goal is to add at least 25 new documents and 20 translations to the new Desktop category.
