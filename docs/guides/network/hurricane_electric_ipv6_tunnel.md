# Hurricane Electric IPv6 tunnel

IPv6 needs no introduction, but in case you are not aware, IPv6 is the replacement for the more popular IPv4 protocol that uses 128-bit hexadecimal addresses instead of 32-bit decimal ones.

[Hurricane Electric](https://he.net) is an internet service provider. Among its other service, Hurricane Electric runs the free [Tunnel Broker](https://tunnelbroker.net/) service to give IPv6 connectivity behind IPv4-only networks.

## Introduction

Thanks to IPv4.

## Prerequisites

- A [free Hurricane Electric IPv6 tunnel](https://tunnelbroker.net/)

- A Rocky Linux server with a public IP address and non-filtered Internet Control Message Protocol (otherwise known as ICMP).

## Getting an IPv6 tunnel

First, create an account at [tunnelbroker.net](https://tunnelbroker.net/).

When you have an account, select **Create Regular Tunnel** in the **User Functions** sidebar:

Then enter in your public IPv4 address, select your endpoint location and click **Create Tunnel**.

## Setting up the IPv6 tunnel

The good news is that an IPv6 tunnel only needs one command:

```bash
nmcli connect add type ip-tunnel ifname he-sit mode sit remote IPV4_SERVER ipv4.method disabled ipv6.method manual ipv6.address IPV6_CLIENT ipv6.gateway IPV6_SERVER
```

Replace the following with the details from your Hurricane Electric portal:

- `IPV4_SERVER` with the **Server IPv4 Address**
- `IPV6_SERVER` with the **Server IPv6 Address**
- `IPV6_CLIENT` with the **Client IPv6 Address**
