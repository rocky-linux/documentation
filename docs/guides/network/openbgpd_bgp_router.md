# OpenBGPD BGP Router

## Introduction

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol that holds the internet together. It's how you can view this document regardless of who your Internet Service Provider is.

[OpenBGPD](http://openbgpd.org/) is [OpenBSD's](https://www.openbsd.org/) cross-platform BGP implementation. The author uses it personally on their network.

## Prerequisites

- A server, virtual machine, or lab network with BGP connectivity
- An AS number from your [Regional Internet Registry](https://www.nro.net/about/rirs/)
- An owned or leased IPv4 or IPv6 block
- Knowledge of network administration

## Installing packages

As OpenBGPD is not in the default repositories, first install the EPEL repository (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux):

```bash
dnf install -y epel-release
```

Subsequently, install OpenBGPD:

```bash
dnf install -y openbgpd
```

## Setting up OpenBGPD

Let's start with a fresh OpenBGPD configuration:

```bash
rm /etc/bgpd.conf
touch /etc/bgpd.conf
chmod 0600 /etc/bgpd.conf
```

Then, add the following to `/etc/bgpd.conf`:

```bash
AS YOUR_ASN
router-id YOUR_IPV4

listen on 127.0.0.1
listen on YOUR_IPV4
listen on ::1
listen on YOUR_IPV6
log updates
network IPV4_TO_ADVERTISE/MASK
network IPV6_TO_ADVERTISE/MASK

allow to ebgp prefix { IPV4_TO_ADVERTISE/MASK IPV6_TO_ADVERTISE/MASK }

neighbor PEER_IPV4 {
    remote-as               PEER_ASN
    announce IPv4           unicast
    announce IPv6           none
    local-address           YOUR_IPV4
}

neighbor PEER_IPV6 {
    remote-as               PEER_ASN
    announce IPv4           none
    announce IPv6           unicast
    local-address           YOUR_IPV6
}
```

Replace the following information:

- **YOUR_ASN** with your AS number.
- **YOUR_IPV4** with your server's IPv4 address.
- **YOUR_IPV6** with your server's IPv6 address.
- **PEER_ASN** with your upstream ISP's AS number.
- **PEER_IPV4** with your upstream ISP's IPv4 address.
- **PEER_IPV6** with your upstream ISP's IPv6 address.

The above lines mean the following:

- The `AS` line contains your BGP AS number.
- The `router-id` line contains your BGP router ID. This is an IPv4 address but can be a dummy non-routable address (e.g. 169.254.x.x) if you are doing IPv6-only BGP.
- The `listen on` line tells which interfaces to listen to. We should listen on all interfaces speaking BGP.
- The `network` lines add the networks we want to advertise.
- The `allow to ebgp prefix` line adds [RFC8212](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8212) compliance for routing security. Some hosting companies, such as BuyVM, require this.
- The `neighbor` blocks specify each IPv4 and IPv6 peer.
- The `remote-as` line specifies the upstream's AS number.
- The `announce IPv4` line specifies whether we should announce `unicast` IPv4 routes or `none`. This should be `none` on an IPv6 upstream.
- The `announce IPv6` line specifies whether we should announce `unicast` IPv6 routes or `none`. This should be `none` on an IPv4 upstream.
- The `local-address` line is the upstream's IPv4 or IPv6 address.

Some upstreams may use an MD5 password or BGP multihop. Should that be the case, your `neighbor` blocks will look like this:

```bash
neighbor PEER_IPV4 {
    remote-as               PEER_ASN
    announce IPv4           unicast
    announce IPv6           none
    local-address           YOUR_IPV4
    multihop                2
    local-address           203.0.113.123
}

neighbor PEER_IPV6 {
    remote-as               PEER_ASN
    announce IPv4           none
    announce IPv6           unicast
    local-address           YOUR_IPV6
    multihop                2
    local-address           2001:DB8:1000::1
}
```

You will need to enable IP forwarding by setting these `sysctl` values:

```bash
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1
```

Now, we should enable OpenBGPD and forwarding:

```bash
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
systemctl enable --now bgpd
```

## Checking BGP status

Once OpenBGPD is enabled, you can see the BGP status:

```bash
bgpctl show
```

You will see the output:

```bash
Neighbor                   AS    MsgRcvd    MsgSent  OutQ Up/Down  State/PrfRcvd
BGP_PEER             PEER_ASN       164         68     0 00:32:04      0
```

You can also see the BGP advertised routes:

```bash
bgpctl show rib
```

If working correctly, you should see the BGP routing table:

```bash
flags: * = Valid, > = Selected, I = via IBGP, A = Announced,
       S = Stale, E = Error
origin validation state: N = not-found, V = valid, ! = invalid
aspa validation state: ? = unknown, V = valid, ! = invalid
origin: i = IGP, e = EGP, ? = Incomplete

flags  vs destination          gateway          lpref   med aspath origin
AI*>  N-? YOUR_IPV4/24         0.0.0.0           100     0 i
AI*>  N-? YOUR_IPV6::/48       ::                100     0 i
```

## Conclusion

While BGP may seem daunting initially, once you master it, you can get your piece of the internet routing table. OpenBGPD's simplicity makes having a software router or anycast server even easier. Enjoy!
