# VMware Tools™ installation

VMware Tools™ is a suite of utilities that enhances the performance and management of virtual machines (VMs) running on VMware virtualization platforms such as VMware vSphere, VMware Workstation, and VMware Fusion. VMware Tools™ improve the interaction between the guest operating system and the host environment.

## Prerequisites and assumptions

* a desire to manage VMware instances with VMware Tools™
* the ability to escalate privileges with `sudo`
* it is assumed that you are starting with a Rocky Linux minimal installation

## Installation of needed packages

Install X11 VMware driver:

```bash
sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-vmware
```

Install kernel-devel and kernel-headers:

```bash
sudo dnf install kernel-devel kernel-headers
```

Install `perl` if not already installed:

```bash
sudo dnf install perl
```

Reboot your system:

```bash
sudo shutdown -r now
```

## Mounting VMware Tools™

### Mount VMware Tools™ in the graphical interface

Right-click VM in the virtual machine menu, then click Guest > Install/Upgrade VMware Tools™.

> VM Tab => Select Install VMware Tools

Mounting VMware Tools CDROM complete.

### Mounting VMware Tools™ from the command-line

Create a mount point for VMware Tools™ and mount it:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom 
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
mount: /mnt/cdrom: WARNING: source write-protected, mounted read-only.
```

Check if `/dev/cdrom` mounted or not:

```bash
sudo df -h

```

## Installing VMware Tools™

Copy the VMware Tools™ gzip file to local `/tmp` directory with this command:

```bash
cp /mnt/cdrom/VMwareTools-10.3.23-16594550.tar.gz /tmp/
```

Extract `tar.gz` file into a new directory called `/tmp/vmware-tools-distrib`:

```bash
[root@localhost cdrom]# cd /tmp/
[root@localhost tmp]# tar -zxvf VMwareTools-10.3.23-16594550.tar.gz vmware-tools-distrib/

!!! Warning

    Before you start, you need to check whether the `/etc/init.d` directory exists or not.
    If not you may see the following error:
    
    >What is the directory that contains the init directories (rc0.d/ to rc6.d/)?

    Solution:

    ```bash
    sudo su
    [root@localhost etc]# clear
    [root@localhost etc]# cd /etc/
    [root@localhost etc]# mkdir init.d
    [root@localhost etc]# cd init.d
    [root@localhost etc]# for i in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
    > do
    > mkdir rc$i.d
    > done
    [root@localhost etc]# cd /tmp/vmware-tools-distrib/
    [root@localhost vmware-tools-distrib]# ./vmware-install.pl 
    ```

!!! Warning

    Be careful changing the default init script directory which should be `/etc/init.d/`.

    >What is the directory that contains the init directories (rc0.d/ to rc6.d/)? 
    >[/etc] /etc/init.d

    >INPUT: [/etc/init.d]

    >The path "/etc/init.d" is a directory which does not contain a rc0.d directory.

To run the PERL script, change to the vmware-tools-distrib directory and run `vmware-install.pl`:

```bash
sudo cd /tmp/vmware-tools-distrib/
sudo ./vmware-install.pl

If you are running GUI, you need to restart your system:

```bash
sudo shutdown -r now
```

## Check VMware installation

```bash
  sudo /etc/init.d/vmware-tools start

## Conclusion

We started with a minimal installation of Rocky Linux, which led to many deficiencies and encountered errors along the way. Despite this, we managed to install and run VMware Tools™, albeit with some challenges.
