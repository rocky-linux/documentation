## Introduction

This Gemstone explains the differences between `git pull` and `git fetch` commands. It also outlines when to use each command appropriately.

## Git Fetch vs Git Pull

### Git Fetch

git fetch downloads changes from a remote repository but doesn't integrate them into your local branch.

Seeing what others have committed without merging those changes into your local branch is beneficial.

1. List the currently checked-out branch

     ```bash
     git branch
     ```

2. Fetch changes from the main branch of a remote repo named origin. Type:

     ```bash
     git fetch origin main
     ```

3. Compare the changes between the HEAD of your local repo and the remote origin/main repo.

     ```bash
     git log HEAD..origin/main
     ```

### Git Pull

Git Pull downloads changes and merges them into your current branch.
It is useful for quickly updating your local branch with changes from the remote repository.

1. **Pull and Merge Changes**:

     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

2. **Review merged changes**:

     ```bash
     git log
     ```

## Additional Notes

- **Use `git fetch`**:
-- When you need to review changes before merging.
-- To avoid unwanted changes or conflicts in your local branch.

- **Use `git pull`**:
-- When you want to update your local branch with the latest commits.
-- For quick, straightforward updates without needing to review changes first.

## Conclusion

Understanding the distinctions between `git fetch` and `git pull` is vital for effective Git workflow management. Choosing the right command based on your requirements is important when working or collaborating via version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, etc.
