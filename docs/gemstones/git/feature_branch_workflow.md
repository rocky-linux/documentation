## Feature Branch Workflow

This popular git workflow involves creating new branches for every new feature or fixes directly in the main repository.
Itâ€™s usually employed in projects where contributors have direct push access to the repository.

This Gemstone outlines the process of setting up a local repository to work on and contribute to the `rocky-linux/documentation` project using the Git Feature Branch Workflow.

The user "rockstar" has forked this repository, and we will use `https://github.com/rockstar/documentation` as the origin.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account and a fork of the project (e.g., `https://github.com/rockstar/documentation`).
- `git` and `GitHub CLI (gh)` installed.

## Procedure

1. If not already done, clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rockstar/documentation.git
   cd documentation
   ```

2. Add the upstream remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/rocky-linux/documentation.git
   ```

3. Fetch Upstream changes:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

4. Create a New Feature Branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```

5. Make changes, add new files, and commit them:

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Implementing feature X"
     ```

6. Keep Your Branch Updated. Regularly merge changes from upstream to avoid conflicts:

     ```bash
     git pull upstream main --rebase
     ```

7. Push to your fork, type:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch-name
   ```

8. Create a Pull Request:

   ```bash
   gh pr create --base main --head rockstar:feature-branch-name --title "New Feature X" --body "Long Description of the feature"
   ```

## Conclusion

The Feature Branch workflow is a common collaboration technique, allowing teams to work concurrently on various aspects of a project while maintaining a stable main codebase.

The high-level steps involved are:

1. Clone the Main Repository: Directly clone the main project repository to your local machine.
2. Create a Feature Branch: For every new task, create a new branch of the main branch with a descriptive name.
3. Commit Changes: Work on the feature or fix in your branch and commit changes.
4. Keep Branch Updated: Regularly merge or rebase with the main branch to stay updated on changes.
5. Open a Pull Request: Push the branch to the main repository and open a PR for review once your feature is ready.
6. Code Review and Merge: The branch is merged into the main branch after review and approval.

*Benefits*:

- Streamlines contributions for regular contributors with direct repository access.
- Ensures each feature is reviewed before being integrated into the main codebase.
- Helps maintain a clean and linear project history.
