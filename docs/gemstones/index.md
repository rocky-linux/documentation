# Gemstones

Welcome to **Gemstones**! 
_"What on earth are Gemstones, and how do they fit into Rocky Linux documentation?"_ That is a very good question. 
While **Guides** contains our normal length how-to documentation and **Books** contain our longer-form documentation, **Gemstones** are just little gems of wisdom. Have a favorite bit of Linux code that you use all the time or a favorite command? Maybe you've written a `bash` or `python` or `other` time-saving script, that you would like to share? If any of these things are true, **Gemstones** is the place for your contribution!

## Criteria

Your code, script, or command document should be short. If it is many pages long, then it belongs elsewhere in the documentation. We are looking for a couple of paragraphs or a page. In order for your "gemstone" to be complete, we suggest including:

* A good description
* Any reasons why you do things a particular way, in the case of a script
* A brief conclusion

## Contribution

You can contribute your **Gemstone** in the same way that you contribute other documentation (see: [Contribution Guide](../guides/contribute/README.md)). When you submit a pull request to GitHub, include "gemstone" in the commit message. If you don't have or don't want a GitHub account, you can simply submit it to the [Mattermost Documentation channel](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation) and we will edit and create your **Gemstone** for you. It couldn't be easier!
