# Introduction

Since the release of Rocky Linux 9, some installations on x86-64 platforms have failed with a kernel panic. In most cases, ==this is due to the CPU's incompatibility== with Rocky Linux 9. This procedure will verify CPU compatibility before installation. **Update:** This procedure now also reflects the minimum processor compatibility for Rocky Linux 10.

## Testing

1. Obtain a boot image of Rocky Linux 8, Fedora, or others.

2. Boot this live image on the machine where you want to install Rocky Linux 9.

3. After the boot completes, open a terminal window and run this procedure:

    ```bash
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep x86-64
    ```

    You should receive output similar to this:

    ```bash
    Usage: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 [OPTION]... EXECUTABLE-FILE [ARGS-FOR-PROGRAM...]
    This program interpreter self-identifies as: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
    x86-64-v4
    x86-64-v3
    x86-64-v2 (supported, searched)
    ```

    This output indicates the minimum required x86-64 version (v2). Installation can continue in this case. If "(supported, searched)" is missing next to the "x86-64-v2" entry, then your CPU is **not** compatible with Rocky Linux 9.x. If the test indicates that your installation can proceed and it also lists x86-64-v3 (required for Rocky Linux 10) and x86-64-v4 as "(supported, searched)", your CPU is well-supported for 9.x and future versions.
