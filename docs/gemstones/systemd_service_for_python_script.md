# `systemd` Service for a Python script

If, like many sysadmins, you are an aficionado of cron scripts launched with `* * * * * /I/launch/my/script.sh`, this article should make you think of another way to do it using all the power and ease offered by `systemd`.

We will write a python script that will provide a continuous loop to execute the actions you define.

We will see how to run this script as a `systemd` service, view the logs in journalctl, and see what happens if the script crashes.

## Prerequisites

Let's start by installing some python dependencies needed for the script to use journalctl:

```
shell > sudo dnf install python36-devel systemd-devel
shell > sudo pip3 install systemd
```

## Writing the Script

Let's consider the following script `my_service.py`:

```
"""
Sample script to run as script
"""
import time
import logging
import sys
from systemd.journal import JournaldLogHandler

# Get an instance of the logger
LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Instantiate the JournaldLogHandler to hook into systemd
JOURNALD_HANDLER = JournaldLogHandler()
JOURNALD_HANDLER.setFormatter(logging.Formatter(
    '[%(levelname)s] %(message)s'
))

# Add the journald handler to the current logger
LOGGER.addHandler(JOURNALD_HANDLER)
LOGGER.setLevel(logging.INFO)

class Service(): # pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
    """
    Launch an infinite loop
    """
    def __init__(self):

        duration = 0

        while True:
            time.sleep(60)
            duration += 60
            LOGGER.info("Total duration: %s", str(duration))
            # will failed after 4 minutes
            if duration > 240:
                sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':

    LOGGER.info("Starting the service")
    Service()
```

We start by instantiating the necessary variables to send logs in journald. The script then launches an infinite loop and pauses for 60 seconds (which is the minimum of a cron execution, so we can go below this limitation).

!!! Note

    I personally use this script in a more advanced form, which continuously queries a database and executes jobs based on the information retrieved via the rundeck API

## Systemd Integration

Now that we have a script that can serve as a basis for your imagination, we can install it as a systemd service.

Let's create this file `my_service.service` and copy it to `/etc/systemd/system/`.

```
[Unit]
Description=My Service
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 my_service.py
WorkingDirectory=/opt/my_service/

StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=my_service

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

As you can see, the script is launched from `/opt/my_service/`. Remember to adapt the path to your script and the syslog identifier.

Launch and enable the new service:

```
shell > sudo systemctl daemon-reload
shell > sudo systemctl enable my_service.service
shell > sudo systemctl start my_service.service
```

## Tests

We can now view the logs via journalctl:

```
shell > journalctl -f -u my_service
oct. 14 11:07:48 rocky8 systemd[1]: Started My Service.
oct. 14 11:07:49 rocky8 __main__[270267]: [INFO] Starting the service
oct. 14 11:08:49 rocky8 __main__[270267]: [INFO] Total duration: 60
oct. 14 11:09:49 rocky8 __main__[270267]: [INFO] Total duration: 120
```

Now let's see what happens if the script crashes:

```
shell > ps -elf | grep my_service
4 S root      270267       1  0  80   0 - 82385 -      11:07 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/python3 my_service.py
shell > sudo kill -9 270267
```

```
shell > journalctl -f -u my_service
oct. 14 11:10:49 rocky8 __main__[270267]: [INFO] Total duration: 180
oct. 14 11:11:49 rocky8 __main__[270267]: [INFO] Total duration: 240
oct. 14 11:12:19 rocky8 systemd[1]: my_service.service: Main process exited, code=killed, status=9/KILL
oct. 14 11:12:19 rocky8 systemd[1]: my_service.service: Failed with result 'signal'.
oct. 14 11:12:19 rocky8 systemd[1]: my_service.service: Service RestartSec=100ms expired, scheduling restart.
oct. 14 11:12:19 rocky8 systemd[1]: my_service.service: Scheduled restart job, restart counter is at 1.
oct. 14 11:12:19 rocky8 systemd[1]: Stopped My Service.
oct. 14 11:12:19 rocky8 systemd[1]: Started My Service.
oct. 14 11:12:19 rocky8 __main__[270863]: [INFO] Starting the service
```

We can also wait 5 minutes for the script to crash by itself: (remove this for your production)

```
oct. 14 11:16:02 rocky8 systemd[1]: Started My Service.
oct. 14 11:16:03 rocky8 __main__[271507]: [INFO] Starting the service
oct. 14 11:17:03 rocky8 __main__[271507]: [INFO] Total duration: 60
oct. 14 11:18:03 rocky8 __main__[271507]: [INFO] Total duration: 120
oct. 14 11:19:03 rocky8 __main__[271507]: [INFO] Total duration: 180
oct. 14 11:20:03 rocky8 __main__[271507]: [INFO] Total duration: 240
oct. 14 11:21:03 rocky8 __main__[271507]: [INFO] Total duration: 300
oct. 14 11:21:03 rocky8 systemd[1]: my_service.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE
oct. 14 11:21:03 rocky8 systemd[1]: my_service.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.
oct. 14 11:21:03 rocky8 systemd[1]: my_service.service: Service RestartSec=100ms expired, scheduling restart.
oct. 14 11:21:03 rocky8 systemd[1]: my_service.service: Scheduled restart job, restart counter is at 1.
oct. 14 11:21:03 rocky8 systemd[1]: Stopped My Service.
oct. 14 11:21:03 rocky8 systemd[1]: Started My Service.
oct. 14 11:21:03 rocky8 __main__[271993]: [INFO] Starting the service
```

As you can see, the restart feature of systemd is very useful.

## Conclusion

`systemd` and `journald` provide us the tools to make robust and powerful scripts easily enough to replace our old reliable crontab scripts.

I hope this solution will be useful for you.
