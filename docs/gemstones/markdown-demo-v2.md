# Overview

As you can tell by reading, this is a pretty silly example, designed to be used to test some translation issues that we are having. It's fun to write though!

This guide demos popular Markdown tags used on [https://docs.rockylinux.org](https://docs.rockylinux.org)

## The Demo

> This is a quote example. Nicely formatted.

Sometimes you will see things like _this_..

How about a little **bold face**

Most of the time, it straight text like this.

Sometimes you need to show a `command`

Or multiple commands:

```
dnf install my_stapler
dnf update my_pencil
systemctl enable my_stapler
```

At other times, you need bulleted or numbered lists:

- I believe you have my stapler
- If not, please at least return my pencil

1. Here is your broken pencil
2. Sharpening it is useless

And you could need an admonition:

!!! TIP

    Pencils and staplers are really old-school.

More times than not, when a command has multiple options, or you need to list specifics, you might want to use a table to identify things:

|  Tool    |   Use               |   Additional Information                                  |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| pencil   | writing or printing | often replaced with a pen                                 |
| pen      | writing or printing | often replaced with a stylus                              |
| stylus   | writing or printing on an electronic device | sometimes replaced by a keyboard  |
| keyboard | writing or printing on an electronic device | never replaced - used until full of food crumbs |
