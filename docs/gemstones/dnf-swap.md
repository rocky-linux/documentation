# Introduction

In order to make container images and cloud images as small as possible, distribution maintainers and packagers may sometimes ship stripped down versions of popular packages. Examples of stripped down packages bundled with container or cloud images are **vim-minimal, curl-minimal, coreutils-single** and so on.

Although some of the shipped packages are stripped down versions, they are often fully acceptable for most use cases.

For cases, when the stripped down package is not enough, you can use the `dnf swap` command to quickly replace the minimal package with the regular package.

# Objective

This Rocky Linux GEMstone demonstrates how to use **dnf** to _swap_ the bundled `curl-minimal` package with the regular `curl` package.


## Check existing curl variant

While logged into your container or virtual machine environment as a user with Administrative privileges, first verify the variant of `curl` package installed. Type:

```bash
# rpm -qa | grep  ^curl-minimal
curl-minimal-*
```

We have curl-minimal on our demo system!


## Swap curl-minimal for curl

Use `dnf` to swap the installed `curl-minimal` package with regular `curl` package.

```bash
# dnf -y swap curl-minimal curl

```

## Check new curl package variant

To confirm the changes, query the rpm database again for the installed curl package(s) by running:

```bash
# rpm -qa | grep  ^curl
curl-*
```


And it's a GEM !


## Notes

DNF Swap Command

**Syntax**:

```bash
dnf [options] swap <package-to-be-removed> <replacement-package>
```

Under the hood, `dnf swap` uses DNF's `--allowerasing` option to resolve any package conflict issues. Therefore the curl minimal example demonstrated in this GEMstone could also have been done by running:


```bash
dnf install -y --allowerasing curl
```
