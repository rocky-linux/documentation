# `perl` Search and Replace

Sometimes you need to quickly search and replace strings in a file or group of files. There are many ways to do this, but this method uses `perl`

To search for and  replace a particular string across multiple files in a directory, the command would be:

```
perl -pi -w -e 's/search_for/replace_with/g;' ~/Dir_to_search/*.html
```

For a single file that might have multiple instances of the string, you can specify the file:

```
perl -pi -w -e 's/search_for/replace_with/g;' /var/www/htdocs/bigfile.html
```

This command uses vi syntax for search and replace to find any occurrence of a string and replace it with another string across a single or multiple files of a particular type. Useful for replacing html/php link changes embedded in those types of files, and many other things.
