# Introduction

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is a Docker-compatible alternative container runtime that, unlike Docker, is included in the Rocky Linux repositories and can run containers as a `systemd` service.

## Install Podman

Use the `dnf` utility to install Podman:

```bash
dnf install podman
```

## Adding a container

Let us run a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) self-hosted cloud platform as an example:

```bash
podman run -d -p 8080:80 nextcloud
```

You will receive a prompt to select the container registry from which to download. In our example, we will use `docker.io/library/nextcloud:latest`.

Once you have downloaded the Nextcloud container, it will run.

Enter **ip_address:8080** in your web browser (assuming you opened the port in `firewalld`) and set up Nextcloud:

## Running containers as `systemd` services

### Using `quadlet`

Since 4.4, Podman ships with [Quadlet](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html), a systemd generator that can generate unit files for rootless and rootful systemd services.

Quadlet files for rootful services can be placed in 

- `/etc/containers/systemd/`
- `/usr/share/containers/systemd/`

while rootless files can be placed in either of

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/systemd/` or `~/.config/containers/systemd/`
- `/etc/containers/systemd/users/$(UID)`
- `/etc/containers/systemd/users/`

While single containers, pods, images, networks, volumes, and kube files are supported, let's focus on our Nextcloud example. Create a new file `~/.config/containers/systemd/nextcloud.container` with the following content:

```systemd
[Container]
Image=nextcloud
PublishPort=8080:80
```

A [lot of other options](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html#container-units-container) are available.

To run the generator and let systemd know that there is a new service run:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

To now run your service run:

```bash
systemctl --user start nextcloud.service
```

!!! note

    If you created a file in one of the directories for rootful services, omit the `--user` flag.

To automatically run the container upon system start or user login, you can add another section to your `nextcloud.container` file:

```systemd
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

As the generated service files are considered transient, they cannot be enabled by systemd. To mitigate this, the generator manually applies installs during generation. This effectively also enables those services files.

Other file types are supported: pod, volume, network, image, and kube. [Pods](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html#pod-units-pod), for instance, can be used to group containers â€“ the generated systemd services and their dependencies (create the pod before the containers) are automatically managed by systemd.

### Using `podman generate systemd`

Podman additionally provides the `generate systemd` subcommand. It can be used to generate `systemd` service files. 

!!! warning

    `generate systemd` is now deprecated and will not receive further features. The usage of Quadlet is recommended.


Let us now do it with Nextcloud. Run:

```bash
podman ps
```

You will get a list of running containers:

```bash
04f7553f431a  docker.io/library/nextcloud:latest  apache2-foregroun...  5 minutes ago  Up 5 minutes  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  compassionate_meninsky
```

As seen above, our container's name is `compassionate_meninsky`.

To make a `systemd` service for the Nextcloud container and enable it on reboot, run the following:

```bash
podman generate systemd --name compassionate_meninsky > /usr/lib/systemd/system/nextcloud.service
systemctl enable nextcloud
```

Replace `compassionate_meninsky` with your container's assigned name.

When your system reboots, Nextcloud will restart in Podman.
