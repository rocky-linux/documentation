# Introduction

The Docker Engine can run native Docker-style container workloads on Rocky Linux servers. This is sometimes preferred when running the full Docker Desktop environment.

## Add the Docker repository

Use the `dnf` utility to add the Docker repository to your Rocky Linux server. Type:

```bash
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo
```

## Install the needed packages

Install the latest version of Docker Engine, `containerd`, and Docker Compose, by running:

```bash
sudo dnf -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

## Start and enable Docker (`dockerd`)

Use `systemctl` to configure Docker to automatically startup upon reboot and simultaneously start it now. Type:

```bash
sudo systemctl --now enable docker
```

## Optionally allow a non-root user to manage docker

Add a non-root user to the `docker` group to allow the user to manage `docker` without `sudo`.

This is an optional step, but it can be convenient if you are the system's main user or if you want to allow multiple users to manage docker but do not want to grant them `sudo` permissions.

Type:

```bash
# Add the current user
sudo usermod -a -G docker $(whoami)

# Add a specific user
sudo usermod -a -G docker custom-user
```

To be assigned the new group, you must log out and in again. Check with the `id` command to verify that the group has been added.

### Notes

```docker
docker-ce               : This package provides the underlying technology for building and running docker containers (dockerd) 
docker-ce-cli           : Provides the command line interface (CLI) client docker tool (docker)
containerd.io           : Provides the container runtime (runc)
docker-compose-plugin   : A plugin that provides the 'docker compose' subcommand 
```
