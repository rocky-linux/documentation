## Why this blog?

Towards the end of 2024, it became evident that not every document in the Rocky Linux documentation cache will be an how-to guide. We needed a spot for longer, more in-depth explanations. Enter this blog.

## Who can write here?

Since this blog is still new, we are still formulating the rights and privileges for creating content. For now, contributors to this blog will include current writers and editors for the documentation project. If you would like to contribute a document here, open an [issue in documentation](https://github.com/rocky-linux/documentation/issues). In the subject of the issue include "Blog/Wiki" anywhere in the title. Consider these items before suggesting:

* Does it fit here? For instance, is this a fit for this blog-style format? Is it information worth sharing?
* Does it expand on a subject important to documentarians?
* Will the submission enhance the overall quality of all of the Rocky Linux documentation?

Further updating of this document will occur when we make final decisions on the guidelines for creating content.

## What kind of information?

The first two documents here should give you an idea of what fits. Throughout 2024, we made a concerted effort to eliminate or drastically reduce passive voice in the how-to documents. The document [Active voice: The way to simple, clear, communication](active_voice.md) describes the importance of active voice in the tone of the documentation, the ease of reading and understanding, and the simplification of translation to other languages.  The document [Open source: Why it is never hyphenated](open_source.md) discusses the big debate over this subject and the reasoning behind our decision not to hyphenate. Get the idea? These are informative documents that do not include how-to information, except perhaps as examples.

## Growth of this blog?

The expectation is that this set of documents will grow more slowly than the how-to documents. That is alright. It is the quality and fit of the documents here that is most important.

## Feedback

As with the documentation project as a whole, you can give feedback in our [Documentation Mattermost channel](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation). If you have an idea for a document that you think will fit here, you can open an issue in the repository to request an opinion on it first. That way you can know ahead of time if your document idea is a good fit.
