# Introduction

A fictitious company (called Example Incorporated) is the subject for designing the labs. Example Incorporated has offices all over the world. Example Incorporated makes widgets. The company has all the usual bells and whistles that a modern company requires to conduct its business. 

The Example Organization has Networked Branch offices, with computers which perform different roles. Some computers are workstations, some are firewalls, and some are servers (file servers, web servers, mail servers, database servers, application servers, dialup servers, etcetera). 

And of most significant importance to us in this manual – the company has administrators administer/manage the computers. You, The Reader, will be the administrator at one of the branch offices.

You will be working with a partner (who is also an administrator) to make sure that the Company’s systems are up and running all the time. Example Incorporated deploys Rocky Linux on its Systems because it has High Standards and Requirements for the Hardware and Software that it utilizes.

The user can do tasks from the command line (the shell) of the Linux Operating System. The user can also do these tasks from the Operating System's Graphical User Interface (GUI). Most of our work, however, will be done from the command line in this manual. 

The idea is to get you comfortable working with the command line, after which there will be no task you cannot perform from the command line. 

The command line is a fast way to get things done, and it is also one of the features of Linux (besides the Kernel) that you will find remains consistent in its look, feel, and functionality amongst the various versions of Linux.
