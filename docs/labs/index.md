# Rocky Linux Tutorial Labs

What are **Labs** and how do they differ from longer-form documentation like **Books**? Well the **Labs** section is designed for step by step work through of processes that can further your understanding. They include exercises to test your knowledge. These labs are intended to be purely for educational and instructional purposes only. They are designed to help you understand particular System Administration topics, stimulate experiementations, encourage collaboration and so on - in a safe and simulated lab environment.

Do you have experience in a subject that would translate into a lab? That's great! We would love your participation here. Getting involved is no different than getting involved with any of Rocky Linux documentation -- simply head over to the [Mattermost Documentation channel](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation), join the conversation, let us know what you would like to write, and we will help you on your way.
