# Rocky Linux Tutorial Labs

What are **Labs** and how do they differ from longer-form documentation like **Books**? Well the **Labs** section is designed for step by step work through of processes that can further your understanding. They include exercises to test your knowledge. These are educational documents with an emphasis on "educational." They are designed to help you with your understanding of a particular subject and provide working knowledge at the same time. Whew! That is a lot, isn't it?

Do you have experience in a subject that would translate into a lab? That's great! We would love your participation here. Getting involved is no different than getting involved with any of Rocky Linux documentation. Simply head over to the [Mattermost Documentation channel](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation), join the conversation, let us know what you would like to write, and we will help you on your way.
