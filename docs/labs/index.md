# Rocky Linux tutorial labs

What are **Labs** and how do they differ from longer-form documentation like **Books**? Well **Labs** are for step by step processes that can further your understanding. They include exercises to test your knowledge. The intention of these labs is to be purely for educational and instructional purposes. They will help you understand particular system administration topics, stimulate experimentation, and encourage collaboration in a safe and simulated lab environment.

Do you have experience in a subject that translates into a lab? That is great! We would love your participation here. Getting involved is just like getting involved with any of Rocky Linux documentation -- head over to the [Mattermost Documentation channel](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation), join the conversation, let us know what you want to write, and we will help you on your way.
