## Introduction

The Desktop area is for desktop or shell customizations, desktop application help topics, basically anything that can help a user get the most out of their desktop and applications. If you are unsure where your topic might fit, place your question in the Documentation channel [on our chat server](https://chat.rockylinux.org), or simply submit the document, and we will place it where it fits best. 

Welcome!
