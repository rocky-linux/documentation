## Introduction

From the project's webpage:

> Flatpak is a framework for distributing desktop applications across various Linux distributions. It has been created by developers who have a long history of working on the Linux desktop, and is run as an independent open source project.

Flatpak comes installed by default when installing Rocky Linux with software selections that include GNOME ("Server with GUI" or "Workstation"). Manual installation is also possible. (see included procedure) It is an excellent way to populate your desktop environment with tools you want to use.

## Manual installation

!!! note

    You can skip this step if you are already running the full GNOME Desktop environment described in the introduction.

Install Flatpak with:

```bash
sudo dnf install flatpak
```

Add the Flatpak repository:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

Restart your system:

```bash
sudo shutdown -r now
```

## Flatpak commands

To see a list of all available Flatpak commands:

```bash
flatpak --help
```

This outputs the following:

!!! warning

    If you are on a version of Rocky Linux 9.x, you will experience this bug. When running the command:

    ```bash
    flatpak search [packagename]
    ```

    Where [packagename] is the package you are looking for, you will get:

    ```text
    F: Failed to parse /var/lib/flatpak/appstream/flathub/x86_64/active/appstream.xml.gz file: Error on line 4065 char 29: <p> already set '
      Organic Maps is a free Android & iOS offline maps app for travelers,
      tourists, hikers, drivers, and cyclists.
      It uses crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap data and is developed with love by
      ' and tried to replace with ' ('
    No matches found
    ```

    There is no workaround for this. To avoid the error, use the Flathub resource in this document to obtain and install the desired package.

## Flathub

Flathub is a web resource for obtaining or submitting desktop packages.

To browse Flathub, visit <https://flathub.org/>. A huge list of curated desktop packages exists here, nicely divided into categories.

## Using Flathub with Flatpak

As an example, the installation process for OBS Studio is:

1. Open the "Audio & Video" section on Flathub

2. Select "OBS Studio" from the list

3. Click the down arrow next to the "Install" button

    ![flathub_install_1](images/01_flatpak.png)

    ![flathub_install_2](images/02_flatpak.png)

4. Ensure you have completed all of the installation prerequisites for Rocky Linux (number 1 in the second image, which is already completed above) and then copy the command (number 2 in the second image) and paste that into a terminal

    ```bash
    flatpak install flathub com.obsproject.Studio
    Looking for matches…
    Required runtime for com.obsproject.Studio/x86_64/stable (runtime/org.kde.Platform/x86_64/6.6) found in remote flathub
    Do you want to install it? [Y/n]: Y
    ```

5. When you answer "Y" and hit ++enter++, you will see the following:

    ```bash
    com.obsproject.Studio permissions:
    ipc                             network         pulseaudio              wayland

    4.     org.kde.PlatformTheme.QGnomePlatform                  6.6            i          flathub           < 9.7 MB

    7.     com.obsproject.Studio                                 stable         i          flathub         < 207.7 MB

    Proceed with these changes to the system installation? [Y/n]:
    ```

6. Answering "Y" and hitting ++enter++ will change system permissions as noted and install the application.

7. If all goes well, you should receive:

    ```text
    Installation complete.
    ```

8. From the "Activities" menu, you can now search for and run OBS Studio.
