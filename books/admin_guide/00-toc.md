# Learning Linux with Rocky

The Administration Guide is a collection of Educational Documents focused on System Administrators. They can be used by future System Administrators trying to get up to speed, by current System Administrators who would like a refresher, or by any Linux user who'd like to learn more about the Linux environment, commands, processes, and more. Like all documents of this type, it will evolve and update over time.

Initially, we will discuss Linux, distributions, and the whole ecosystem around our operating system.

We will then look at the user commands that are essential for getting up to speed with Linux. The more experienced users should also consult the chapter dedicated to the more "advanced" 'Commands.'

Next comes the chapter on the VI editor. While Linux comes with many editors, VI is one of the most powerful. Other commands sometimes use identical syntaxes as VI (`sed` comes to mind). So knowing something about VI, or at least demystifying its essential functions (how to open a file, save, quit or quit without saving), are very important to know. The user will become more comfortable with the other functions of VI as they use the editor. An alternative would be to use nano which comes installed by default in Rocky Linux. While not as versatile, it is simple to use, straightforward, and gets the job done.

We can then get into the deep functioning of Linux to discover how the system manages:

* users.
* file systems.
* processes.

Next, we will cover an essential subject for the System Administrator: The Backup Process. Many software solutions come with Linux to enhance Backups (rsnapshot, lsyncd, etcetera.)It is good to know the essential components of the backup that are within the operating system. We will investigate two tools: `tar` and the less widespread `cpio` in this chapter.

Management of the system during the boot process has evolved significantly in recent years since the arrival of the systemd.


We will conclude by examining the management of tasks, the implementation of the network, and software installation.
