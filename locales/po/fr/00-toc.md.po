"The Administration Guide is a collection of Educational Documents focused on "
"System Administrators. They can be used by future System Administrators "
"trying to get up to speed, by current System Administrators who would like a "
"refresher, or by any Linux user who'd like to learn more about the Linux "
"environment, commands, processes, and more. Like all documents of this type, "
"it will evolve and update over time."

"Next comes the chapter on the VI editor. While Linux comes with many "
"editors, VI is one of the most powerful. Other commands sometimes use "
"identical syntaxes as VI (`sed` comes to mind). So knowing something about "
"VI, or at least demystifying its essential functions (how to open a file, "
"save, quit or quit without saving), are very important to know. The user "
"will become more comfortable with the other functions of VI as they use the "
"editor. An alternative would be to use nano which comes installed by default "
"in Rocky Linux. While not as versatile, it is simple to use, "
"straightforward, and gets the job done."

"Backup Process. Many software solutions come with Linux to enhance Backups "

"tools: `tar` and the less widespread `cpio` in this chapter."
